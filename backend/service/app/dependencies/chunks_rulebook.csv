Calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts

1.

To calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, risk weights

shall be applied to all exposures, unless deducted from own

funds, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2. The

application of risk weights shall be based on the exposure

class to which the exposure is assigned and, to the extent

specified in Section 2, its credit quality. Credit quality may be

determined by reference to the credit assessments of ECAIs or

the credit assessments of Export Credit Agencies in accordance

with Section 3.

2.

For the purposes of applying a risk weight, as referred to

in paragraph 1, the exposure value shall be multiplied by the

risk weight specified or determined in accordance with Section

2.

3.

Where an exposure is subject to credit protection the risk

weight applicable to that item may be amended in accordance

with Chapter 4.

4.

Risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitised exposures

shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5.

5.

Exposures for which no calculation is provided in Section

2 shall be assigned a risk-weight of 100 %.

6.

With the exception of exposures giving rise to Common

Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 items, an institution

may, subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities,

decide not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of thisCalculation",2

to the exposures of that institution to a counterparty

which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary, a subsidiary of its

parent undertaking or an undertaking linked by a relationship

within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC.

Competent authorities are empowered to grant approval if the

following conditions are fulfilled:

(a) the counterparty is an institution, a financial holding

company or a mixed financial holding company, financial

institution, asset management company or ancillary services

undertaking subject to appropriate prudential requirements;

(b) the counterparty is included in the same consolidation as

the institution on a full basis;

(c) the counterparty is subject to the same risk evaluation,

measurement and control procedures as the institution;

(d) the counterparty is established in the same Member State as

the institution;

(e) there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal

impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or

repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the insti­

tution.

Where the institution, in accordance with this paragraph, is

authorised not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1, it

may assign a risk weight of 0 %.

7.

With the exception of exposures giving rise to Common

Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 items, institutions

may, subject to the prior permission of the competent auth­

orities, not apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article

to exposures to counterparties with which the institution has

entered into an institutional protection scheme that is a

contractual or statutory liability arrangement which protects

those institutions and in particular ensures their liquidity and

solvency to avoid bankruptcy where necessary. Competent auth­

orities are empowered to grant permission if the following

conditions are fulfilled:

(a) the requirements set out in points (a), (d) and (e) of

paragraph 6 are met;

(b) the arrangements ensure that the institutional protection

scheme is able to grant support necessary under its

commitment from funds readily available to it;

(c) the institutional protection scheme disposes of suitable and

uniformly stipulated systems for the monitoring and clas­

sification of risk, which gives a complete overview of the

risk situations of all the individual members and the insti­

tutional protection scheme as a whole, with corresponding

possibilities to take influence; those systems shall suitably

monitor

(d) the institutional protection scheme conducts its own risk

review which is communicated to the individual members;

(e) the institutional protection scheme draws up and publishes

on an annual basis, a consolidated report comprising the

balance sheet, the profit-and-loss account, the situation

report and the risk report, concerning the institutional

protection scheme as a whole, or a report comprising the

aggregated balance sheet, the aggregated profit-and-loss

account, the situation report and the risk report, concerning

the institutional protection scheme as a whole;

(f) members of the institutional protection scheme are obliged

to give advance notice of at least 24 months if they wish to

end the institutional protection scheme;

(g) the multiple use of elements eligible for the calculation of

own funds (hereinafter referred to as 'multiple gearing') as

well as any inappropriate creation of own funds between

the members of the institutional protection scheme shall be

eliminated;

(h) The institutional protection scheme shall be based on a

broad membership of credit institutions of a predominantly

homogeneous business profile;

(i) the adequacy of the systems referred to in points (c) and (d)

is approved and monitored at regular intervals by the

relevant competent authorities.

Exposures to regional governments or local authorities

1.

Exposures to regional governments or local authorities

shall be risk-weighted as exposures to institutions unless they

are treated as exposures to central governments under para­

graphs 2 or 4 or receive a risk weight as specified in

paragraph 5. The preferential treatment for short-term

exposures specified in Article 119(2) and Article 120(2) shall

not be applied.

2.

Exposures to regional governments or local authorities

shall be treated as exposures to the central government in

whose jurisdiction they are established where there is no

difference in risk between such exposures because of the

specific revenue-raising powers of the former, and the

existence of specific institutional arrangements the effect of

which is to reduce their risk of default.

EBA shall maintain a publicly available database of all regional

governments and local authorities within the Union which

relevant competent authorities treat as exposures to their

central governments.

Exposures

to

churches

or

religious

communities

constituted in the form of a legal person under public law

shall, in so far as they raise taxes in accordance with legislation

conferring on them the right to do so, be treated as exposures

to regional governments and local authorities. In this case,

paragraph 2 shall not apply and, for the purposes of",5
"Article150(1)(a),

150(1)(a), permission to apply the Standardised

When competent authorities of a third country juris­

diction which applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements

at least equivalent to those applied in the Union treat exposures

to regional governments or local authorities as exposures to

their central government and there is no difference in risk

between such exposures because of the specific revenue-

raising powers of regional government or local authorities

and to specific institutional arrangements to reduce the risk of

default, institutions may risk weight exposures to such regional

governments and local authorities in the same manner.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commission may adopt,

by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination

procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether

a third country applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements

at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence

of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may

continue to apply the treatment set out in this paragraph to

the third country where the relevant competent authorities had

approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before

1 January 2014.

Exposures to regional governments or local authorities of

the Member States that are not referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4

For exposures to public sector entities with an original

maturity of three months or less, the risk weight shall be 20 %.

In exceptional circumstances, exposures to public-sector

entities may be treated as exposures to the central government,

regional government or local authority in whose jurisdiction

they are established where in the opinion of the competent

authorities of this jurisdiction there is no difference in risk

between such exposures because of the existence of an appro­

When competent authorities of a third country juris­

diction, which apply supervisory and regulatory arrangements

at least equivalent to those applied in the Union, treat exposures

entities in the same manner. Otherwise the institutions shall

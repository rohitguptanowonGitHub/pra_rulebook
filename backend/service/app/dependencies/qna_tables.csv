Subject matter Safeguarding with a credit institition in a third country

Question

May a PI authorised and operating in an EU Member State use a credit

institution based in a third country (e.g. UK) for the purpose of safeguarding

funds in accordance with Art. 10(1)(a) of PSD2?

Background on the

This topic is important as the number of banks offering safeguarding

question

services is increasingly limited.

12 of 34Final answer

Article 10 of PSD2 requires payment institutions (PIs) to safeguard funds

which have been received from the payment service users or through

another payment service provider for the execution of payment transactions,

using one or several of the safeguarding methods set out in that Article.

Article 10(1)(a) of PSD2 refers to funds deposited in a separate account with

a credit institution or invested in secure, liquid low-risk assets, as defined by

the competent authorities of the home Member State.

The term ‘Credit Institution’ as defined in Article 1(a) of PSD2 refers to

Article 4(1)(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements

for credit institutions and investment firms (the CRR) “including branches

thereof […] where such branches are located in the Union, whether the head

offices of those branches are located within the Union or, in accordance with

Article 47 of Directive 2013/36/EU and with national law, outside the Union”.

Article 4(1)(1) of CRR defines a credit institution “as an undertaking the

business of which is to: (a) take deposits or other repayable funds from the

public and to grant credits for its own account […]”.

This definition applies to institutions authorised to operate within the EEA.

As highlighted in Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit

institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and

investment firms (CRD), in conjunction with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No

1024/2013, the granting of licences to credit institutions remains in the

remit of the competent national authorities under the ECB’s control and final

responsibility.

It follows from the above that the reference to a ‘credit institution’ in Article

10(1)(a) of PSD2 refers only to credit institutions authorised in the EU/EEA.

and branches that are authorised to operate in the EU/EEA of undertakings

established in a third country as referred to in Article 47 Directive

2013/36/EU.

Subject matter Provision of the ""acquiring of payment transactions"" payment service in the

EU

Question

Please provide your opinion on whether the payment service – acquiring of

payment transactions on an EU webshop – can be provided by a payment

service provider from a third country. Please refer to Q&A 4233.

Background on the

Following the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union on 31

question

January 2020 (Brexit), several UK financial institutions made enquiries

regarding their possibilities to provide payment services after Brexit.

The European Banking Authority addressed communications to payment

service users and UK financial institutions (link:

https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/brexit), explaining the

meaning of the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the EU and UK, in

the context of the provision of services by UK financial institutions in the EU.

14 of 34These explanations were very helpful; nevertheless, there are certain issues

that require further clarification.

Furthermore, we would like to consider this question as not limited to UK

financial institutions, but in the context of financial institutions from all the

third countries (outside EEA, hereinafter referred to as EU).

Payment services in the EU can be provided by the payment service

providers listed in Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2). Financial

institutions from the countries outside the EU not holding a valid

authorisation issued by the supervisory authorities in the EU do not have the

right to provide payment services in the EU.

On the other hand, payment service users from the EU may maintain their

bank accounts held with financial institutions outside the EU and can use

payment services provided by the financial institutions from non-EU

countries, as long as they are provided outside the EU.

Financial institutions from third countries may provide payment services to

payment service providers from the EU as long as they do not have physical

substance on the EU territory and as long as they do not actively solicit such

customers from the EU.

Please bear in mind the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/751 of the

European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on interchange fees

for card-based payment transactions. In order to limit the scope of

Regulation (EU) 2015/751 to ""card-based payment transactions carried out

within the Union, where both the payer's payment service provider and the

payee's payment service provider are located therein"", the Regulation

defines 'point of sale' as:

""(29) ‘point of sale’ means the address of the physical premises of the

merchant at which the payment transaction is initiated. However:

(a) in the case of distance sales or distance contracts (i.e. e-commerce) as

defined in point 7 of Article 2 of Directive 2011/83/EU, the point of sale shall

be the address of the fixed place of business at which the merchant conducts

its business regardless of website or server locations through which the

payment transaction is initiated;

(b) in the event that the merchant does not have a fixed place of business,

the point of sale shall be the address for which the merchant holds a valid

business licence through which the payment transaction is initiated;

(c) in the event that the merchant does not have a fixed place of business nor

a valid business licence, the point of sale shall be the address for

correspondence for the payment of its taxes relating to its sales activity

through which the payment transaction is initiated.""

15 of 34Please also bear in mind the EBA's answer provided in Q&A 4233.

EU payment service users should have the same rights while making card

payments in EU stores, no matter whether that store is physical or virtual

(webshop).

Also, EU payment service users should be given the same level of protection

by the provisions of EU law – by the provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/2366

PSD2 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 (RTS on SCA) in

card payments in EU shops (physical and virtual).

The provisions of EU law (PSD2, RTS on SCA, AMLFT provisions, Regulation

(EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees, etc.) do not apply to payment service

providers from third countries.

Final answer

The acquiring of payment transactions, as defined in Article 4, point (44) of

Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2) is a payment service regulated under

PSD2. Accordingly, the provision of such services within the EU requires

authorisation as a payment service provider (PSP), as referred to in Article

1(1) of PSD2.

According to Article 11(1) of PSD2, all entities seeking authorisation as a

payment institution under PSD2 must be a legal person established in a

Member State.

Consequently, entities from third countries that have not been granted

authorisation from competent authorities in a Member State to provide

acquiring services, as listed in Annex I point 5 of PSD2, are not permitted to

offer these payment services within the EU. The same condition regarding

the requirement of establishment in the EU applies to credit institutions

authorised in the EU/EEA. and branches that are authorised to operate in the

EU/EEA of undertakings established in a third country as referred to in

Article 47 Directive 2013/36/EU (please see Q&A 6882); electronic money

institutions, in accordance with Article 3(1) of EMD2, and to other PSPs

listed in Article 1(1) of PSD2, in accordance with the regulations specific to

these entities.

Regarding the obligations of PSPs in relation to the application of SCA rules

in relation to the so-called “one-leg” transactions, where the acquirer (the

payee’s PSP) is located outside the Union, please refer to Q&A 4030 and

Q&A 4233.

Subject matter Definition of ‘project finance loans’ for FINREP reporting

Question

What should be considered as ‘project finance loans’ for financial reporting

purposes (FINREP)? Is deviation from definition of project finance referred

to in Article 147(8) CRR (with regard to conditions a and b) justified?

Background on the

‘Project finance loans’ are reported in FINREP templates F 05.01, row 0130,

question

F 07.01, row 0310 and F 07.02, row 0310 (the latter for nGAAP reporters) in

17 of 34accordance with the instructions in Annex V, Part 2, paragraph 89, to the

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451. According to

paragraph 89 loans shall be classified on the basis of how they can be

recovered. ‘Project finance loans’ shall include loans that meet the

characteristics of specialised lending exposures as referred to in Article

147(8) CRR. However, it is not clear from this instructions whether the

reported item ’project finance loans’ include all (four) types of ’specialised

lending exposures’ (project finance, real estate finance/income producing

real estate, object finance, commodity finance – as specified in paragraph 82

of Annex II to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 and

in Article 1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/598) or only

’project finance’.

Q&A 2013_80 clarifies that the definition of ‘project finance loans’ in

FINREP is not exactly the same as the definition used for ‘specialised lending

exposures’ in Article 147(8) CRR. The answer indicates the following

differences between the two definitions:

object of financing; Q&A narrows the scope of objects being

financed, it refers to the definition provided by the International

Project Finance Association and states that project finance loans

relate to the financing of long-term infrastructure, industrial projects

and public services (based upon a non-recourse or limited recourse

financial structure where project debt and equity used to finance the

project are paid back from the cash-flow generated by the project).

Substantively identical definition was afterwards given in Article 1 of

Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/598 for ‘project finance

exposures’.

the debtor, which is not necessarily entity which was created

specifically to finance or operate physical assets or is an economically

comparable exposure (CRR, Article 147(8), point a)); and

the lender's degree of control over the assets and the income that the

contractual arrangements generate (CRR, Article 147(8), point b)).

The content of EBA answer in Q&A 2013_80 has still not been incorporated

into Annex V although Q&A was published already in February

2014. Additionally, by CRR3 the second subparagraph was added to Article

147(8) CRR, explaining that ‘specialised lending exposures’ shall be

categorised as follows: ‘project finance’, ‘object finance’, ‘commodity

finance’ and ‘income-producing real estate’. Given that Article 147(8) CRR is

legal basis (reference) for reporting ‘project finance’ in FINREP, new

subparagraph in this Article confirms that ‘project finance loans’ reported in

FINREP templates include only one type of ‘specialised lending exposures’,

18 of 34i.e. project finance.

In light of striving to maximum harmonization of definitions for FINREP and

COREP purposes, we suggest to review Q&A 2013_80 and provide adequate

clarification whether it is justified to keep the deviation from complying

exactly with the conditions a) and b) of Article 147(8) of the CRR. Besides

that, it is not clear what does “not complying exactly with the conditions a)

and b) of Article 147(8) of the CRR” actually mean.

Final answer

Annex V, Part 2, paragraph 89, to the Commission Implementing Regulation

(EU) 2021/451 states that: ‘[…] ‘Project finance loans’ shall include loans

that meet the characteristics of specialised lending exposures as referred to

in Article 147(8) CRR’.

Article 147(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) has been now amended

by the Regulation 2024/1623 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(the Capital Requirements Regulation 3 – CRR3) that added the following

subparagraph to article 147(8): ‘Those exposures [specialised lending] shall

be assigned to the exposure class referred to in paragraph 2, point (c)(ii),

and shall be categorised as follows: “project finance” (PF), “object finance”

(OF), “commodity finance” (CF) and “income-producing real estate” (IPRE).’.

In light of article 147(8), ‘project finance loans’ in FINREP includes all (four)

types of 'specialised lending exposures' (project finance, real estate

finance/income producing real estate, object finance, commodity finance).

Therefore, the Q&A n.80/2013 will be flagged as ‘superseded’.

Subject matter Definition of SME in Finrep vs COREP under CRR3 Regulation

Question

Could you confirm whether, with the implementation of Regulation

2024/1623 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation 3 –

CRR3), institutions will be required to report the concept of micro, small and

medium-sized enterprises (SME) differently in FINREP and COREP, as

provided in Recommendation 2003/361/EC and Article 5 point 9 of CRR 3,

respectively?

Background on the In Annex V, Part 1, paragraph 5(i) of Regulation (EU) No

question 2021/451, the definition of SMEs is as set out in Commission

Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003. By contrast, in

CRR 2, the reference to that Commission Recommendation was

only included in Article 501 Adjustment of risk-weighted non-

defaulted SME exposures but only for the purposes of that

article. Consequently, a Q&A was necessary to clarify the use

of the same SME definition for FINREP and COREP, which was

addressed through EBA Q&A 2013_27. In this Q&A, it is

clarified that CRR and COREP should interpret the definition of

SMEs in line with Recommendation 2003/361/EC, i.e., the

definition of SMEs in FINREP and COREP are aligned.

However, with the approval of CRR 3, which will enter into

force on 1 January 2025, a new definition of SMEs is

established in Article 5 point 9 of the CRR, which only takes

into account the criterion of annual turnover (less than EUR 50

million). This definition will be used for reporting in COREP

but not for FINREP, where no change has been introduced.

Final answer

Annex V, Part 1, paragraph 5, point (i) of Commission Implementing

Regulation (EU) 2021/451 defines 'SME' in the following way: 'micro, small

and medium-sized enterprises as defined in Commission Recommendation

C(2003)1422'. This definition of SME should be followed until the publication

of a new Finrep release may review it. This would ensure continuity in the

time series for the time being.

Subject matter Translation risk when calculating total own fund requirements on

consolidated basis using the reporting currency of the consolidated

institution

Question

How should the overall own funds requirements be calculated in a

consolidated situation for institutions or undertakings, for which Art.

325b(4)(b) CRR applies, i.e. if different institutions or undertakings of the

group use different currencies other than the reporting currency of the

group?

Background on the

Pursuant to Art. 325b(4) of CRR, institutions and undertakings shall use the

question

same reporting currency as the reporting currency used to calculate the own

funds requirements for market risk on a consolidated basis for the group. In

case when the calculation currency (i.e., the currency that the institution is

using to calculate its own fund requirements on a solo basis) of institution or

undertaking is different from the reporting currency of the consolidated

situation it is unclear how the consolidating institution should calculate

individual own fund requirements in accordance with Article 325b(4)(b) of

CRR and how translation risks between such currency pairs should be

considered.

The CRR text does not specify how the translation risk between the reporting

currency of the consolidated situation and the calculation currency of the

individual group entity should be considered. Therefore, we have identified

two possible approaches:

a) Approach A: Recalculation of individual entity’s net positions and own

22 of 34fund requirements for market risk with the assumption that the reporting

calculation currency of such entity is the reporting currency of the

consolidated entity. The recalculation should also include the position in the

currency that the institution is using to calculate its local own fund

requirements, against the calculation currency.

b) Approach B: Converting the resulting individual entity’s own funds

requirements into the reporting currency of the consolidated entity using the

prevailing spot exchange rate between the calculation currency of the

individual entity and the reporting currency of the consolidated entity and

not taking into account the translation risk.

Final answer

Where a competent authority has not granted an institution the permission

referred to Article 325b(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) for at least

one institution or undertaking of the group, the institution, when calculating

the own funds requirements for market risk on a consolidated basis, has to

take into account translation risk between the reporting currency of such

individual entity (i.e. the entity for which the positions cannot be netted with

positions in other entities or undertakings of the group) and the reporting

currency used to calculate the own funds requirements at consolidated level.

Approach B in the background of the question fails to meet this principle.

As per the last subparagraph of Article 325b CRR, when calculating the own

funds requirements at consolidated level, the institution have to calculate the

market risk own fund requirements of the individual entity referred in of

Article 325b(4), point (b), CRR using the reporting currency used to

calculate the own funds requirements at consolidated level (as per approach

A).

Subject matter Offsetting position among all group entities without the permission of 325b

Question

In the context of article 352, when an institution is following a strategy of

hedging the consolidated CET1 ratio (as opposed to hedge at solo level) and

has been granted the waiver in art 352.2 at a consolidated level but when

the permission in article 325b is not granted:

Is it necessary to have the netting permission of Article 325b granted to take

into account shorts open position in a subsidiary to calculate the structural

FX position at consolidated level, for the waiver application purposes?

Background on the

The EBA guidelines (EBA/GL/2020/09) to structural FX determines the

question

calculation, governance and application requirements of the exemption so

that it can be approved by the supervisor.

The EBA Guidelines on the calculation of structural FX leaves the point of

calculating the structural position and the offsetting of positions out of the

scope of the guides and gives the option for the supervisor to be the one

who, based on the arguments of the FX calculation entity determines

whether such compensation is appropriate for the purposes of calculating

the open exchange position.

This is clearly stated in the introductory part of the guide:

56. Whether the permission in Article 325 has been granted or not does

change, however, the own funds requirement for market risk (and

accordingly also the FX charge) included in the denominator. In the feedback

from the consultation, the EBA was asked to clarify how institutions should

calculate the net open position when the permission referred to in Article

325 has not been granted. Although the EBA acknowledges that the

level 1 text may leave some room for interpretation around this

aspect, it decided not to address this specific point in these guidelines,

as it goes beyond their scope; indeed, the provision would also be relevant to

institutions not even applying for the structural FX waiver. As a result:

(i) the EBA will investigate the possibility of addressing this issue using

either a Q&A or any other tool that fits the purpose;

(ii) groups not having the permission under Article 325 to offset

positions in all institutions within the group are required to specify

how they compute the own funds requirements for FX risk and to

24 of 34clarify how they plan to remove the positions from the net open

position if the waiver will be granted.

57. The hedging effect that a position has on the ratio does not

depend on whether the permission to offset the positions within the

group has been granted or not. For example, the parent bank of a group

may enter into a short position to reduce the size of a long position stemming

from a subsidiary and in this way reduce the sensitivity of the consolidated

ratio with respect to changes in the exchange rate. Such a hedging effect is

present regardless of whetherthe permission in Article 325 has been granted

or not. This situation is represented in the following example.

60. In general, when the permission in Article 325 has not been

granted (or only partially granted), the guidelines specify that a short

position at the solo level (i.e. at subsidiary level or parent bank level) can

be considered for the exemption at consolidated level only if it has

been taken with the sole purpose of hedging the ratio at the

consolidated level. In addition, when the permission in Article 325 has not

been granted, these guidelines require institutions to specifically describe

how they manage positions that at the solo level are short for the purpose of

hedging the ratio at a consolidated level.

And also in the legal text of the Guidelines the following is stablished:

25. Where the institution computes the own funds requirements of

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for market risk on a consolidated basis

without having the permission referred to in Article 325 of

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the position is net short at the level of

one or more of the institutions within the group, the position in those

institutions should be managed for the sole purpose of hedging the ratio to

be considered eligible for the exemption.

The EBA taking into account all of the above, mentions in their guides that it

is understood that for the purposes of article 352.2 it is not mandatory to

obtain the authorization of article 325b; however, in the case of entities that

do not have it, it is necessary within the scope of the authorization of

structural waiver. FX specify to the competent authority how the entity

computes the own funds requirements and how they plan to eliminate the

position from the net open position.

Final answer

In the context of the consolidated level calculation, paragraphs 25 and 26 of

the EBA Guidelines on the treatment of structural FX under Article 352(2) of

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) (EBA/GL/2020/09, Structural FX GLs)

specify that positions forming a net short position at the level of one entity in

the group, can be part of the waiver when they are taken with the sole

purpose of hedging the ratio.

The provisions included in Article 325b CRR forbids the offsetting of

25 of 34positions between entities in a group for the purpose of computing the own

funds requirement for market risk, unless a specific permission has been

granted by the competent authority.

The Structural FX GLs do not prohibit the offsetting between positions

among entities of the group in absence of the permission referred to in

Article 325b, as the hedging effect of those positions do not depend on the

permission itself. However, they include the condition referred to in

paragraphs 25, 26 (and the condition referred to in paragraph 29(h)(iv)

deriving from them).

Accordingly, when assessing the hedge, or when identifying the positions

that are actually to be removed as a result of the waiver, the institution is

allowed to net those positions that meet the conditions in the GLs for being

waived, regardless of the permission referred to in Article 325b CRR.

In practice, once the positions meeting the conditions in the GLs have been

identified, they can be netted across entities of the group (regardless of the

permission). The institution should then compare the resulting net position

against the maximum open position that can be waived. It therefore can

remove some or all the position, from the net open position in the foreign

currency referred to in Article 352(1). In particular, Where the net open

position at group level that may be waived (because meeting all conditions in

the GLs) is lower than the maximum open positions, then all positions can be

removed. Where the net open position at group level that may be waived

(because meeting all conditions in the GLs) is higher than the maximum open

positions, then the institution should remove some positions. The net

excluded position should equal the maximum open position.

Once, the exclusion is performed, the institution should compute the own

funds requirements for FX risk without offsetting positions across entities,

unless it has the approval referred to in Article 325b.

Example 1:

Take an institution with a parent bank A and a subsidiary B. Assume that the

group does not have the permission referred to in Article 325b.

Let us assume that all positions in USD meet the conditions of the GLs for

being waived. Let us assume that A has a net short position in USD of 30,

and B a long position in USD of 100. Let us assume that the maximum open

position is 80 USD.

The net open position in USD at group level is 70 USD long (100-30). The

maximum open position is 80. Hence, the institution can remove all positions

that constituted the 70 USD long (i.e. they can remove 100 USD from the

subsidiary and 30 USD from the parent bank).

Example 2:

26 of 34Take an institution with a parent bank A and a subsidiary B. Assume that the

group does not have the permission referred to in Article 325b.

Let us assume that all positions in USD meet the conditions of the GLs for

being waived. Let us assume that A has a net short position in USD of 30,

and B a long position in USD of 100. Let us assume that the maximum open

position is 50 USD.

The net open position in USD at group level is 70 USD long (100-30 USD).

The maximum open position is 50 USD. Hence, the institution can remove a

net position of 80 USD from the subsidiary, and the whole short position (30

USD) from the parent bank. In total, the bank removes a net open position of

50 USD (80 - 30 USD), i.e. the maximum net open position that can be

removed.

In principle the institution could also remove a net position of 50 USD

directly from the subsidiary, and not remove any position from the parent

bank. The net open position removed would still be 50. As a result, the bank

would remain with a 50 USD net long position at subsidiary level, and a 30

USD net short position at parent bank level. When computing the own funds

requirement for FX risk the 50 net long and 30 net short position remaining

in the subsidiary and in the parent bank cannot be offset.

This second choice is more conservative than that presented in the previous

paragraph - however, the institution is not obliged to implement this more

conservative choice. Instead, the institution is required to remove a position

that on a net basis (upon all other conditions in the GLs being met) is lower

in size than the maximum open position. In addition the institution should, in

compliance with paragraph 15(b), to specify the methodology that it uses to

calculate the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk and the

methodology it intends to use for removing the position for which they seek

the exemption from the net open position, where they compute the own

funds requirements of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for market risk on a

consolidated basis without having the permission to offset positions in some

institutions or undertakings in the group in accordance with Article 325 of

that Regulation.

Subject matter Consideration of additional items in the calculation of the net open position

or maximum net open position

Question

In the context of art 352 (2) the calculation of the net open position or

maximum net open position in the context of Structural FX framework

should take into consideration items affecting the capital ratio but not

directly related to assets, liabilities or off-balance items such Additional

Value adjustment or minority interests denominated in FX currency?

Background on the

The guidelines on the treatment of structural FX under Article 352(2) of

question

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) refer to the maximum open position or

maximum net open position as the FX risk position neutralising the

sensitivity of the capital ratio to movements in the exchange rate.

There are elements denominated in FX currency that may affect the capital

ratio to movements in the exchange rate. Several of these elements do not

have an accounting impact and/or are not part of the RWA, such as

deductions of prudential filters from the own funds accounting amount.

Examples are Additional Value Adjustments or Excess of minority interests

denominated in FX currency among other.

The EBA guidelines EBA/GL/2020/09 mention in paragraph 107 that “In

particular, the maximum net open position that can be exempted is

defined as the amount of FX risk position that neutralises the

sensitivity of the capital ratio to movements in the exchange rate.“

which may indicate that these regulatory deductions from own funds should

be considered in the maximum open position.

This is also contemplated in paragraph 111 of the EBA Guidelines when

defining the assessment of sensitivity:

“Accordingly, when the sensitivity of the capital ratio to the FX rate is

assessed for the purpose of calculating the maximum open position that can

28 of 34be recognised as structural, the capital ratio should be that without

considering any own funds requirements for FX risk”

It is not clear if the formula prescribe in paragraph 114 includes these

deductions in the CET1 as it is defined as “the Common equity Tier 1 of the

institution (expressed in the reporting currency)”. But it is clear that this

paragraph links the position to be excluded with the ratio hedge formula,

even more so if the management policy is the full immunization of the ratio.

In paragraph 117 certain elements that do not impact CET1 but that lead to

losses that do not impact CET1 are to be excluded from the net open position

as long as they are structural. The same could be understood for deductions

from the numerator of the capital ratio with no losses affecting CET1 such as

Additional value adjustments or minority interest deductions.

“As part of the consultation, some respondents identified another case of

positions that do not impact the CET1, although included in the net open

position in the foreign currency. The example was provided of some positions

arising from minority interests that do not impact the CET1….” That is, it is

referring to the excess of minorities. “…. The EBA agrees with the analysis

provided by those respondents; hence, the guidelines have been amended,

specifying that all positions leading to gains or losses that do not impact the

CET1 are to be excluded from the net open position as long as they are

structural (i.e. they are not subject to the cap imposed by the maximum open

position). In other words, all those positions are to be treated as items

that were deducted from the CET1 in the context of the structural FX

framework”

Final answer

Article 352(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) deals with Structural

FX provision. In that paragraph, it is stated that '...The same treatment

subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an

institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the

calculation of own funds'. Given that positions that are deducted from the

own funds can be waived as part of the Structural FX treatment, institutions

must include them in the first place in the net open position referred to in

Article 352(1) CRR.

The EBA Guidelines on the treatment of structural FX under Article 352(2) of

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (EBA/GL/2020/09, GLs) identify a specific

treatment for those positions in the context of the maximum open position.

As per paragraph 35 of the GLs, institutions can remove those positions

(when they are structural) from the net open position, without taking into

account the cap imposed by the net open position.

It should be noted that Article 325(1), second subparagraph, as amended by

Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (CRR3) specifies that 'by way of derogation from

the first subparagraph, an institution shall not calculate an own funds

29 of 34requirements for foreign exchange risk for trading book positions and non-

trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk where those

positions are deducted from the institution’s own funds'. Accordingly, once

that amendment becomes applicable, institutions shall remove positions that

are deducted in the first place from the own funds requirements for FX risk

(as they will be excluded in the first place, the structural FX provision would

not be relevant for them).

Subject matter Perfectly matched back-to-back bought and sold options under market risk

capital requirement - sensitivities-based method for calculating the own

funds requirement.

Question

In accordance with Article 325e of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), all

the positions of instruments with optionality (among others: calls, puts, caps,

floors, swap options, barrier options and exotic options) shall be subject to

the own funds requirements for:

a) delta risk

b) vega risk

c) curvature risk.

30 of 34According to Q&A Q&A 2571 published on 11th November 2016, perfectly

matching options should not be subject to own funds requirements for

market risk.

Does this also apply to the sensitivities-based method for calculating the own

funds requirement for market risk specified in CRR2/CRR3?

If yes, does it mean that perfectly matched back-to-back bought and sold

options can be excluded from the calculation of the own funds requirement

for market risk under sensitivities-based method (delta, vega and curvature

risk)?

Background on the

Q&A 2571 published in Single Rulebook Q&A on 11th November 2016)

question

states that perfectly matching options should not be subject to market

capital requirements.

Final answer

Perfectly matching bought and sold options are included in the scope of the

own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risk under the SbM.

In accordance with Article 325u(4), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR), perfectly matching positions are excluded from the scope of

the own funds requirements for residual risks (RRAO). Given that they are

explicitly referred to in the context of the RRAO as excluded, but not

explicitly mentioned or excluded in the context of the sensitivities-based

method (SbM) or the own funds requirements for default risk (DRC), both

the own funds requirements under the SbM and the DRC (where applicable)

have to be the determined for such positions.

Sensitivities and Jump-to-default-amounts may then be netted in line with the

provisions of the CRR.

Subject matter Card data (PAN) to be returned in AISP calls

Question

Does the ASPSP have to return the card number (PAN) attached to a fetched

payment account in case the user can access this data during a standard

session with its ASPSP in the direct internet banking interface? In case of

""YES"", does the TPP that is fetching this data have to be PCI DSS certified,

since this data has to be encrypted based on the PCI DSS requirements?

Moreover, could be the ""card number (PAN)"" considered sensible, since it

could be potentially used for fraud?

Background on the

The PSD2, art. 67.3.(b) states that In relation to payment accounts, an

question

ASPSP shall treat data requests transmitted through the services of an

account information service provider without any discrimination for other

than objective reasons. Stating this, there are many ASPSP direct baking

interfaces where the PSU can have access to credit/debit card data like card

number (PAN), date of expiration, CVV, by accessing it directly or through an

additional layer of security. In this case, as stated in the RTS on SCA, art.

32.1, the ASPSP that has put in place a dedicated interface shall ensure that

the dedicated interface offers at all times the same level of availability and

performance, including support, as the interfaces made available to the PSU

for directly accessing its payment account online. It means that the TPPs

need to have access to the specified data in case it's available in the direct

interface. On the other hand, this data has to be managed under the PCI DSS

protocols and thus all actors that have access to it need to be certified. It

would require additional certification burdens for the TPPs since they will

have to manage the data received from the ASPSP. For ASPSP instead is

generated a new challenge of monitoring the level of compliance of the

connected TPPs with the PCI DSS, which currently is impossible, because

the eIDAS certificates don't carry this information.

However, there is another situation in how the card number can be treated.

As stated in art. 4.(32) of the PSD2, sensitive data means data, including

personalized security credentials which can be used to carry out fraud. We

can assume that the card number can be used for fraud intentions, even

without having the other parts of the data set like expiry date and CVV.

Moreover, art. 67.2.(e) of the PSD2 states that an AISP shall not request

sensitive payment data linked to the payment accounts. We would like to

32 of 34understand how the EBA treats this data.

Final answer

Under Article 4(12) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, of 25 November 2015, on

payment services in the internal market (PSD2), ‘payment account’ means an

account held in the name of one or more payment service users (PSUs)

which is used for the execution of payment transactions.

‘Payment instrument’ is, in turn, defined as a personalised device(s) and/or

set of procedures agreed between the PSU and the payment service provider

and used to initiate a payment order (Article 4(14) of the PSD2).

Even though there are account servicing payment service providers

(ASPSPs) that allow PSUs to have access via the online banking interfaces to

credit/debit card data like the card number, the date of expiration, the card

verification value (CVV), by accessing that data directly online or through an

additional layer of security, that does not constitute payment account

information.

Rather, it constitutes information regarding a specific payment instrument

that has been assigned to the holder of the payment account. It is clear from

the two definitions cited above that the concepts of ‘payment account’ and

‘payment instrument’ are not to be used interchangeably, even if ‘transaction

data’ that is accessible to PSUs may include a limited set of data on the

payment instrument that has been used to initiate a given transaction.

It follows from the above that ASPSPs do not have to offer Account

Information Service Providers (AISPs) the possibility to view the card

number linked to a payment account in case the PSU can access that data

during a standard session with its ASPSP in the online banking interface.

Subject matter Immovable property risk weights under the standardised approach

(residential)

Question

Is the 35% standardised risk weight applicable to exposures fully and

completely secured by mortgages on residential property outside the Union?

Background on the

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) allows for exposures

question

fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential property to receive

a 35% risk weight where the conditions in 125(2) are met unless otherwise

decided by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 124(2).

Competent authorities can increase risk weights in their territory based on

loss experience and forward-looking property market developments but the

Regulation is silent on how risk weights should be determined for property

markets outside the Union .e.g. Hong Kong.

Final answer

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does apply to

exposures secured by mortgages on residential property outside of the

Union. Article 124(2) requires in the fifth subparagraph that for property in

their territory, competent authorities have to set a higher risk weight

corresponding to the actual risks under certain conditions. For third

1 of 2countries, Article 124(2) does not establish such a requirement but

competent authorities are still able to set higher risk weights or apply

stricter criteria for exposures secured by immovable property located in

third countries based on financial stability considerations as set out in the

second, third and fourth subparagraphs and after consultation with EBA in

accordance with the sixth subparagraph.

DISCLAIMER:

This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of

the regulatory framework. A Directorate General of the Commission

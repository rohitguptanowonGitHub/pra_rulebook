REPORTS AND REVIEWS",3
"Article 502

Cyclicality 502

Cyclicality of capital requirements

The Commission, in cooperation with EBA, ESRB and the

Member States, and taking into account the opinion of the

ECB, shall periodically monitor whether this Regulation taken

as a whole, together with Directive 2013/36/EU has significant

effects on the economic cycle and, in the light of that examin­

ation, shall consider whether any remedial measures are

justified. By 31 December 2013, EBA shall report to the

Commission if and how methodologies of institutions under

the IRB Approach should converge with a view to more

comparable capital requirements while mitigating pro-cyclicality.

Based on that analysis and taking into account the opinion of

the ECB, the Commission shall draw up a biennial report and

submit it to the European Parliament and to the Council,

together with any appropriate proposals. Contributions from

credit taking and credit lending parties shall be adequately

acknowledged when the report is drawn up.

By 31 December 2014 the Commission shall review and report

on the application of Article 33(1)(c) and shall submit that

report to the European Parliament and the Council, together

with a legislative proposal if appropriate.

With respect to the potential elimination of the Article 33(1)(c)

and its potential application at the Union level, the review shall

in particular ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to

ensure financial stability in all Member States.",4

The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after

consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and to the

Council, together with any appropriate proposals, on whether

the risk weights laid down in Article 129 and the own funds

requirements for specific risk in Article 336(3) are adequate for

all the instruments that qualify for these treatments and whether

the criteria in Article 129 are appropriate.

2.

The report and the proposals referred to in paragraph 1

shall have regard to:

(a) the extent to which the current regulatory capital

requirements applicable to covered bonds adequately differ­

entiate between variances in the credit quality of covered

bonds and the collateral against which they are secured,

including the extent of variations across Member States;

(b) the transparency of the covered bond market and the extent

to which this facilitates comprehensive internal analysis by

investors in respect of the credit risk of covered bonds and

the collateral against which they are secured and the asset

segregation in case of the issuer's insolvency, including the

mitigating effects of the underlying strict national legal

framework in accordance with Article 129 of this Regu­

lation and Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC on the

overall credit quality of a covered bond and its implications

on the level of transparency needed by investors; and

(c) the extent to which covered bond issuance by a credit

institution impacts on the credit risk to which other

creditors of the issuing institution are exposed.

The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after

consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and the

Council on whether loans secured by aircrafts (aircraft liens)

and whether residential loans secured by a guarantee, but not

secured by a registered mortgage, should under certain

conditions be considered as an eligible asset in accordance

with Article 129.

4.

The Commission shall, by 31 December 2016, review the

appropriateness of the derogation set out in Article 496 and, if

relevant, the appropriateness of extending similar treatment to

any other form of covered bond. In the light of that review, the

Commission may, if appropriate, adopt delegated acts in

accordance with Article 462 to make that derogation

permanent or make legislative proposals to extend it to other

forms of covered bonds.",5

Exposures 125

Exposures fully and completely secured by mortgages on

residential property

1.

Unless otherwise decided by the competent authorities in

accordance with Article 124(2), exposures fully and completely

secured by mortgages on residential property shall be treated as

follows:

(a) exposures or any part of an exposure fully and completely

secured by mortgages on residential property which is or

shall be occupied or let by the owner, or the beneficial

owner in the case of personal investment companies, shall

be assigned a risk weight of 35 %;

(b) exposures to a tenant under a property leasing transaction

concerning residential property under which the institution

is the lessor and the tenant has an option to purchase, shall

be assigned a risk weight of 35 % provided that the

exposure of the institution is fully and completely secured

by its ownership of the property.

2.

Institutions shall consider an exposure or any part of an

exposure as fully and completely secured for the purposes of

paragraph 1 only if the following conditions are met:

(a) the value of the property shall not materially depend upon

the credit quality of the borrower. Institutions may exclude

situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both

the value of the property and the performance of the

borrower from their determination of the materiality of

such dependence;

(b) the risk of the borrower shall not materially depend upon

the performance of the underlying property or project, but

on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the

debt from other sources, and as a consequence, the

repayment of the facility shall not materially depend on

any cash flow generated by the underlying property

serving as collateral. For those other sources, institutions

shall determine maximum loan-to-income ratios as part of

their lending policy and obtain suitable evidence of the

relevant income when granting the loan.

(c) the requirements set out in Article 208 and the valuation

rules set out in Article 229(1) are met;

(d) unless otherwise determined under Article 124(2), the part

of the loan to which the 35 % risk weight is assigned does

not exceed 80 % of the market value of the property in

question or 80 % of the mortgage lending value of the

property in question in those Member States that have

laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the

mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provi­

sions.

For the purposes of an estimate of alpha under

paragraph 9, an institution shall ensure that the numerator

and denominator are calculated in a manner consistent with

the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and

portfolio composition. The approach used to estimate α shall

be based on the institution's internal capital approach, be well

documented and be subject to independent validation. In

addition, an institution shall review its estimates of alpha on

at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the

composition of the portfolio varies over time. An institution

1, where an institution is a client, it may calculate the own

funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related trans­

actions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306

(a) the positions and assets of that institution related to those

transactions are distinguished and segregated, at the level of

both the clearing member and the CCP, from the positions

and assets of both the clearing member and the other

clients of that clearing member and as a result of that

distinction and segregation those positions and assets are

bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency

of the clearing member or one or more of its other clients;

(b) laws, regulations, rules and contractual arrangements

applicable to or binding that institution or the CCP facilitate

the transfer of the client's positions relating to those

contracts and transactions and of the corresponding

collateral to another clearing member within the applicable

margin period of risk in the event of default or insolvency

of the original clearing member. In such circumstance, the

client's positions and the collateral shall be transferred at

market value unless the client requests to close out the

position at market value;

(c) the institution has available an independent, written and

reasoned legal opinion that concludes that, in the event of

legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative auth­

orities would find that the client would bear no losses on

account of the insolvency of its clearing member or of any

of its clearing member's clients under the laws of the juris­

diction of the institution, its clearing member and the CCP,

the law governing the transactions and contracts the insti­

tution clears through the CCP, the law governing the

collateral, and the law governing any contract or

agreement necessary to meet the condition in point (b);

Without prejudice to the conditions specified in paragraph

2, where an institution that is a client is not protected from

losses in the case that the clearing member and another client

of the clearing member jointly default, but all the other

conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met, the client may

Exposures 132

Exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs

1.

Exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs shall be

assigned a risk weight of 100 %, unless the institution applies

the credit risk assessment method under paragraph 2, or the

look-through approach in paragraph 4 or the average risk

weight approach under paragraph 5 when the conditions in

paragraph 3 are met.

2.

Exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs for

which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available

shall be assigned a risk weight according to Table 8 which

corresponds to the credit assessment of the ECAI in accordance

with Article 136.

Institutions may determine the risk weight for a CIU in

accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5, if the following eligibility

criteria are met:

(a) the CIU is managed by a company that is subject to super­

vision in a Member State or, in the case of third country

CIU, where the following conditions are met:

Official Journal of the European Union

L 176/85

(i) the CIU is managed by a company which is subject to

supervision that is considered equivalent to that laid

down in Union law;

(ii) cooperation between competent authorities is suffi­

ciently ensured;

(b) the CIU's prospectus or equivalent document includes the

following:

(i) the categories of assets in which the CIU is authorised to

invest;

(ii) if investment limits apply, the relative limits and the

methodologies to calculate them;

(c) the business of the CIU is reported on at least an annual

basis to enable an assessment to be made of the assets and

liabilities, income and operations over the reporting period.

For the purposes of point (a), the Commission may adopt, by

way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination

procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to

whether a third country applies supervisory and regulatory

arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the

Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January

2015, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set

out in this paragraph to exposures in the form of units or

shares of CIUs from third countries where the relevant

competent authorities had approved the third country as

eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014.

4.

Where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures

of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in

order to calculate an average risk weight for its exposures in the

form of units or shares in the CIUs in accordance with the

methods set out in this Chapter. Where an underlying

exposure of the CIU is itself an exposure in the form of

shares in another CIU which fulfils the criteria of paragraph

3, the institution may look through to the underlying

exposures of that other CIU.

5.

Where the institution is not aware of the underlying

exposures of a CIU, it may calculate an average risk weight

for its exposures in the form of a unit or share in the CIU in

accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter subject to

the assumption that the CIU first invests, to the maximum

extent allowed under its mandate, in the exposure classes

attracting the highest capital requirement, and then continues

making investments in descending order until the maximum

total investment limit is reached.

Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate

and report, in accordance with the methods set out in para­

graphs 4 and 5, a risk weight for the CIU:

(a) the depository institution or the depository financial insti­

tution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests

in securities and deposits all securities at that depository

institution or the financial institution;

(b) for CIUs not covered by point (a), the CIU management

company, provided that the CIU management company

meets the criteria set out in paragraph 3(a).

The correctness of the calculation referred to in the first

subparagraph shall be confirmed by an external auditor.",42

Subject matter Determination of risk weight for a pass-through SPE exposure with

underlying assets where the transaction does not fulfil the conditions for

securitisations according to Article 4(1)(61) CRR.

Question

Should an exposure to an SPE transaction with underlying assets and a

single class of debt (pass-through structure), which does not fulfil the

criteria of Securitisation, be recognised to determine the risk weight of the

exposure by applying a look-through approach to the underlying assets as

suggested by Article 390(7) CRR regarding large exposures treatment?

Or should such exposure be treated as a (unrated) corporate exposure in

accordance with Article 122 CRR?

Background on the

A credit institution needs to determine risk weights on individual and group

question

level. Local GAAP for individual reporting may not allow a look-through for

an exposure to an SPE with underlying assets as consolidation may be

1 of 5limited to group reports always assuming the institution holds the majority of

risk and rewards.

Respectively, with regard to Part II of the CRR a pass-through exposure to an

SPE with underlying assets which does not fall under the definition of

Securitisation could be considered a corporate exposure following local

GAAP on individual basis and, as such, entirely abstract from the risk weight

of the underlying assets.

Article 5(1) CRR defines the term Exposure generically as an ""asset or off-

balance sheet item"". Regarding large exposure regulation Article 390(7) CRR

clearly stipulates a look-through for such ""other transactions where there is

an exposure to underlying assets"".

Final answer

Unless otherwise provided, Part Three (Capital requirements) and Part Four

(Large exposures) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) are to be

separately applied as they refer to different types of requirements. Article

390(7) CRR is therefore not to be applied for the purposes of calculation of

the minimum capital requirements according to Part Three of the CRR.

Where the definition of a securitisation in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)

2017/2402 (SecReg) is not met, such exposures cannot be treated under the

securitisation framework.

For the treatment for the purpose of the calculation of the minimum capital

requirements, it should then be verified whether the exposures in question

can be considered as exposures in the form of units or shares of collective

investment undertakings (CIU). For the question whether the SPE qualifies

as a CIU or not, see Q&A 4502.

In the case the SPE were considered a CIU, it might apply the look-through

approach (in accordance with Article 132a(1)) or the mandate-based

approach (in accordance with Article 132a(2)) if the conditions set out in

Article 132(3) are met. If the look- through approach or the mandate-based

approach are not applicable, the risk weight is always 1250% (‘fall-back

approach’) according to Article 132(2) CRR or Article 152(6) CRR.

Where the SPE does not qualify as a CIU, the exposure should be assigned to

the “corporates” exposure class according to Article 112 (g) of the CRR.

Subject matter Interaction between Qualified CCPs and Reporting

Question

Institutions must meet higher capital requirements as long as CCPs are not

qualified. Most of the Clearing organisations are working for many years on

the derivative market. Will EBA (or national competent authorities) create an

interim agreement for that special issue? CCPs are already supervised by

their national financial authorities.

Background on the

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR – EU 575/2013) differentiates

question

between ‘qualified’ and ‘non-qualified’ Central Counterparties. A ‘Qualified

Central Counterparty’ needs to be authorised by ESMA, related to article 14

of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR – EU 648/2013) or

– in case of third-country CCPs – they will be accepted under Article 25 of

EMIR. Otherwise a Central Counterparty is a ‘non-qualified CCP’. ESMA has

informed that there is no authorised Central Counterparty in Europe, and

they do not expect authorisations until 1Q 2014. From an institution's point

of view is it very important to manage their trade exposures by ‘Qualified

CCPs’ because those circumstances have an impact on the capital

requirements of institutions. If an institution transacts a derivative by a

‘Qualified CCP’, the derivative will have a risk weight of two per cent – in

relation to Article 306 (1)(a) of CRR. Is the CCP ‘non-qualified’, the credit

risk will be calculated accordingly to Article 107 (2 b) CRR – based on Article

306 (1b) – which means: Credit Risk Standardised Approach. Based on

Article 112 (g) - which is the next step in that “waterfall-model” - the

exposure class ‘Corporates’ has to be used. The table of Article 122 shows

3 of 5the risk weights for corporates, percentages between 20 and 150, which

means normally 100 per cent. The next point is: CCPs have to be rated in

accordance with article 136 et seq. Under this article EBA, EIOPA and ESMA

have to formulate technical operating standards no later than 1st July 2014.

(But this is only a 'sideshow'.) Institutions are in a difficult situation at the

moment. Central question – two per cent or 100 per cent risk weigt for trade

exposure?

Final answer

If a central counterparty (""CCP"") has been either authorised or recognised in

accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (EMIR), then it is a qualifying

CCP and can be treated as such for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR).

If a CCP has not yet been authorised or recognised in accordance with EMIR

and the grandfathering period (including any extension thereof) specified in

Article 497 of the CRR has not yet elapsed, then the CCP can be treated as a

QCCP for the purposes of the CRR.

If a CCP has not yet been authorised or recognised in accordance with EMIR

and the grandfathering period (including any extension thereof) specified in

Article 497 of the CRR has elapsed, then the CCP must be treated as a non-

qualifying CCP for the purposes of the CRR.

Please also refer to Q&A 1126 for further details.

DISCLAIMER:

This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of

the regulatory framework. A Directorate General of the Commission

(Directorate General for Internal Market and Services) has prepared the

answer, albeit that only the Court of Justice of the European Union can

provide definitive interpretations of EU legislation. This is an unofficial

opinion of that Directorate General, which the European Banking Authority

publishes on its behalf. The answers are not binding on the European

Commission as an institution. You should be aware that the European

Subject matter Unterstützungsfaktor für Infrastrukturprojekte - Supporting factor for

infrastructure projects

Question

Können sowohl der in Artikel 501 CRR genannte Faktor zur Unterstützung

von KMU als auch der in Artikel 501a CRR genannte Faktor zur

Unterstützung von Infrastruktur auf eine Risikoposition angewandt werden?

Can the supporting factor for SMEs referred to in Article 501 CRR and the

infrastructure supporting factor referred to in Article 501a CRR both be

applied to an exposure?

Background on the

Es ist gemäß den neuen Bestimmungen nicht ganz klar, ob beide

question

Unterstützungsfaktoren gleichzeitig zur Anwendung gelangen dürfen, sofern

1 of 8die entsprechenden Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind.

Gemäß Artikel 501a CRR kann eine Risikoposition mit 0,75 multipliziert

werden, wenn die Risikoposition der Risikopositionsklasse „Unternehmen“

zugeordnet werden kann und weitere Kriterien erfüllt sind. Für das Institut

stellt sich nun die Frage, ob der Faktor zur Unterstützung von KMU gemäß

Artikel 501 CRR auch dann herangezogen werden kann, wenn es sich bei

dem Kreditnehmer um ein KMU handelt.

Beispiel:

Ein KMU nimmt einen Kredit über 500.000 Euro auf, um die Infrastruktur

für E-Mobilität in der Stadt auszubauen.

RWA = 500.000 x 0,75 x 0,7619 = 285.712,50

Under the new provisions, it is not entirely clear whether, provided that the

relevant conditions are met, both supporting factors may be applied

simultaneously.

In accordance with Article 501a CRR, a risk position can be multiplied by

0.75 if the risk position can be assigned to the risk position class ""company""

and further criteria are met. The question now arises for the institution as to

whether the SME support factor in accordance with Article 501 CRR can also

be used if the borrower is an SME.

Example:

An SME takes out a loan of 500,000 euros to expand the infrastructure for e-

mobility in the city.

RWA = 500,000 x 0.75 x 0.7619 = 285,712.50

Final answer

Ja, der in Artikel 501 CRR genannte Faktor zur Unterstützung von KMU und

der in Artikel 501a CRR genannte Faktor zur Unterstützung von

Infrastruktur können gleichzeitig angewandt werden, wenn die

einschlägigen Bedingungen für beide Unterstützungsfaktoren erfüllt sind.

Für die Anwendung des Faktors zur Unterstützung von KMU wird in

Artikel 501 Absatz 2 Buchstabe b CRR der Begriff „KMU“ in

Übereinstimmung mit der Empfehlung 2003/361/EG der Kommission

definiert, diese Definition wird jedoch dadurch näher bestimmt, dass unter

den in Artikel 2 des Anhangs dieser Empfehlung aufgeführten Kriterien nur

der Jahresumsatz berücksichtigt wird.

Für die Anwendung des Unterstützungsfaktors bei Infrastrukturprojekten

verlangt Artikel 501a Absatz 1 Buchstabe b CRR neben den in all den

2 of 8anderen Punkten aufgeführten Kriterien, dass die Risikoposition gegenüber

einem Rechtsträger besteht, „der speziell zur Finanzierung oder zum Betrieb

von physischen Strukturen oder Anlagen, Systemen und Netzen, die

grundlegende öffentliche Dienste erbringen oder unterstützen, errichtet

wurde““.

IDie CRR enthält keine Anforderung, derzufolge sich die jeweiligen

Anwendungsbereiche bezüglich der sich qualifizierenden Unternehmen

gegenseitig ausschließen.

Wenn also eine Risikoposition gegenüber einem Unternehmen besteht, das

die Definition von „KMU“ gemäß Artikel 501 Absatz 2 Buchstabe b der CRR

erfüllt und gleichzeitig alle in Artikel 501a(1) und (2) aufgeführten Kriterien

erfüllt, können Institute bei der Berechnung der Kapitalanforderungen beide

Unterstützungsfaktoren nacheinander und in beliebiger Reihenfolge

anwenden.

Haftungsausschluss: Die Antworten stellen Bestimmungen klar, die

bereits in der geltenden Rechtsvorschriften enthalten sind. Sie erweitern in

Yes, the supporting factor for SMEs referred to in Article 501 CRR and the

infrastructure supporting factor referred to in Article 501a CRR can apply

simultaneously where the relevant conditions for both of those supporting

factors are met.

For the application of the SME supporting factor, Article 501(2), point (b)

CRR defines “SME” in accordance with Commission Recommendation

2003/361/EC, but qualifies that definition by stating that among the criteria

listed in Article 2 of the Annex to that Recommendation, only the annual

turnover shall be taken into account.

For the application of the supporting factor for infrastructure projects,

Article 501a(1), point (b) CRR, requires, among the criteria listed in all the

other points, that the exposure is to “an entity which was created specifically

3 of 8to finance or operate physical structures or facilities, systems and networks

that provide or support essential public services”.

There is nothing in the CRR that requires that the respective scopes of

qualified entities are to be mutually exclusive.

Accordingly, where an exposure is towards an entity that meets the

definition of “SME” as referred to in Article 501(2), point (b), of CRR and at

the same time complies with all the criteria listed in Article 501a, (1) and (2)

CRR, institutions can apply both supporting factors, subsequently and in a

random order, for the calculation of capital requirements.

Subject matter Treatment of SME-supporting factor in the case of secured exposures.

Question

I. How should the SME-supporting factor be treated relating to secured

exposures? a) Including all collaterals, i.e. also for guarantees. Thus risk

weighted assets of inflow in asset class sovereigns or institutes will also be

reduced? b) Only for those collaterals which cause no risk transfer (meaning

which are intered directly in the RWA formula)? c) Only for the non-secured

part of the exposure?

II. General question when the SMR supporting factor can be used: a) To our

understanding a risk transfer is only allowed in the case that the risk

transfer is leading to a reduction of the RWA. Taking this into account it

should always be compared “the total SME exposure with the supporting

factor and without a risk transfer” to “the exposure with the SME supporting

factor (only for the non-secured part) and the risk transfer without the

supporting factor”. b) To consider the above mentioned point under II. a) it

seems that banks under the IRB-A approach are by tendency favored as

there is no risk transfer (e.g.in cases of a guarantee by a government) but

the effect of the collateral is considered in the total LGD of the exposure.

Background on the

On closer examination of CRR and Annex II Instructions (templates) some

question

questions of interpretation come up how the SME-supporting factor has to

be applied.

Final answer

Further to Q&A 257, the factor of 0,7619 defined in Article 501(1) of

Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) applies to the risk-weighted exposure

amounts for credit risk on non-defaulted exposures to SMEs which meet the

eligibility requirements under Article 501(2). Eligibility is based on the

nature of the counterparty and on some characteristics of the exposure (e.g.

classification according to the CRR and amount).

Accordingly, where an exposure to an SME is eligible, capital requirements

are calculated by multiplying applying the factors defined in Article 501(1) of

0,7619 by to the risk-weighted exposure value after taking into account value

adjustments and credit risk mitigation techniques permissible under Article

108 of the CRR. Pursuant to Article 501(2)(a) of the CRR, in order to meet

the eligibility requirements, the exposures shall should always be included

either in the 'retail' or in the 'corporates' or 'secured by mortgages on

immovable property' classes irrespective of whether credit risk mitigation

5 of 8techniques with substitution effects (e.g. guarantees) are reclassified for

reporting purposes to another exposure class.

Subject matter The meaning of the ""amount owed to the institution""

Question

How should institutions understand the ""amount owed to the institution""

under Article 501(2)(c)(1) in case of off-balance sheet exposures to

customers that haven’t yet been used? Is it the exposure value (as

understood in Article 111) or the nominal value of such product (for example

credit line)?

Background on the

The question focuses on off-balance sheet products like credit lines with low

question

CCFs (credit conversion factors). Depending on the amount taken into

account (nominal value or exposure) the amount owed to institution from the

customer or group of customers can change in the material way. Moreover,

6 of 8depending on the approach taken, this amount may exceed EUR 1,5m. Credit

lines are popular products for SMEs; if the amount taken into account was

nominal value and not the exposure, this regulation would have a smaller

impact on the SME sector.

Final answer

Article 501(2)(c)(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) refers to

amounts ""owed"" to the institution. Therefore, in the case of a line of credit,

only the drawn amount needs to be considered when checking if the EUR 1,5

million limit is complied with for the formula in the article.

Provided that all conditions of Article 501(1) and (2) of the CRR are met, the

exposure as a whole including its undrawn part can qualify as exposure to an

SME.

Subject matter Definition of SME

Question

SMEs are defined by turnover alone (EUR 50 million according to OJ L 124,

20.05.2003). Our question concerns when turnover is recorded. Is it (i) at

inception of the loan or (ii) on an on-going basis? We would also like to know

what level of documentation/proof is required, if any.

Background on the

Not all of our members, particularly smaller ones, hold turnover data on

question

their systems so will have no actual ""proof"". It would be disproportionately

burdensome for them to start collecting this data, particularly if it had to be

monitored. But it would be relatively straightforward for them to determine

what percentage of their loan book would never exceed the SME turnover

threshold either at inception or during the life of the loan.

Final answer

Under Article 501(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) an SME is

defined in accordance with Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6

May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium sized

enterprises. A deviation results only to the extent that, among the criteria

listed in Article 2 of the Annex to that Recommendation, only the annual

turnover shall be taken into account.

Since the possible relief in capital requirements under Article 501 of the

CRR is limited to exposures to SMEs, it needs to be ensured that this

privilege is not extended inappropriately. An institution therefore needs to

have adequate current information available on an on-going basis and should

be able to adequately demonstrate the fulfilment of this requirement to its

competent authorities.

Subject matter Calculation of the collateral value of immovable property considering

minimum level of over-collateralisation ratio

Question

Should the haircut due to minimum level of over-collateralisation be

reflected in the calculation of collateral value with or without the deducted

prior claims? Besides market value or mortgage lending value is there any

other value that could be considered for the calculation purposes?

Background on the

Standardised approach: According to Article 125 (2)(d) CRR unless

question

otherwise determined under Article 124(2), the part of the loan to which the

35 % risk weight is assigned does not exceed 80 % of the market value of the

property in question or 80 % of the mortgage lending value of the property

1 of 11(for commercial immovable property 50% risk weight applies for the part of

the loan which does not exceed 50% of the market value of the property or

60 % of the mortgage lending value applies according to Article 126 (2) (d)

CRR). F-IRB approach: Pursuant to Article 230 (2) CRR the applicable LGD*

and required collateralization levels for the secured parts of exposures are

set out in Table 5 of this paragraph (for immovable property it is 140%). This

haircut is applied to collateral where a minimum level of over-

collateralisation is required. Alternatives of the calculation logic in case of

Standardised approach and residential property as an example.

(Overcollateralization requirement is 100%/80%=125%):

1. alternative Minimum overcollateralization is applied on the market value

deducted with prior claims. Collateral allocation: Allocation Value = Market

value – prior claims RWA Engine: CRM used effective value = Allocation

Value / Minimum Overcollateralization Example: Allocation Value = 100 –

10=90 CRM used effective value = 90 / 125% = 72

2. alternative Minimum overcollateralization is applied on the market value

but not applied on the deducted prior claims. Collateral allocation: Allocation

Value = min(Market value – prior claims x Minimum Overcollateralization)

RWA Engine: CRM used effective value = Allocation Value / Minimum

Overcollateralization Example: Allocation Value = min( 100 – 10 x

125%)=87,5 CRM used effective value = 87,5 / 125% = 70

Final answer

For immovable property collateral, no value other than the market value or,

in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the

assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory

provisions, the mortgage lending value of the immovable property is

recognised. For determining the maximum recognised percentage under the

standardised approach or the applicable LGD* and the required

collateralisation levels for the secured parts of IRB exposures, the value to

be used is either the market value or, in those Member States that have laid

down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in

statutory or regulatory provisions, the mortgage lending value to derive in a

first step the maximum amount which may receive the privileged risk weight

dedicated to the recognition of immovable property collateral, which may, as

applicable, in a second step be reduced to take in particular account of any

prior claims on the immovable property.

1. Standardised approach (SA)

Under the SA for credit risk, the conditions in Article 124(1) for considering

an exposure or part of an exposure as fully secured by mortgages on

immovable property and in Articles 125(2) and 126(2) CRR for considering

an exposure or part of an exposure as fully and completely secured by

mortgages on residential or commercial immovable properties, respectively,

exclusively refer to (i) the market value of the immovable property or (ii) the

2 of 11mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous

criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or

regulatory provisions. Consequently, no other value is recognised for this

purpose.

For the same purpose, the conditions in Articles 125(2)(c) and 126(2)(c) CRR

require that the valuation rules set out in Article 229(1) CRR are met, where

the last sub-paragraph requires that the market value or mortgage lending

value shall be reduced as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring

required under Article 208(3) CRR and to take account of any prior claims on

the immovable property.

As a consequence, for determining the part of the loan to which the risk

weight for the fully and completely secured part is assigned, the maximum

recognised percentage of the market value or mortgage lending value in

those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the

assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory

provisions, according to Article 125(2)(d) or 126(2)(d) CRR applies to the

market value or mortgage lending value, as applicable, after being reduced,

as appropriate, to take account of any prior claims on the immovable

property or of the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3)

CRR.

Therefore, only the calculation provided as alternative 2 in the background

on the question leads to the correct result.

2. IRB Approach

Under the IRB Approach, for the purpose of recognising immovable property

collateral in accordance with Article 199(1)(a) CRR, the criteria in Article

230 CRR for determining the applicable LGD* and the required

collateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures refer to the value

of the collateral.

For this purpose, Article 229(1) CRR requires the value of the collateral to be

the market value or or mortgage lending value, similarly to how this is

specified in the SA.

Also in line with the SA, the last sub-paragraph of Article 229(1) CRR

requires that the market value or mortgage lending value shall be reduced

as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring required under Article

208(3) CRR and to take account of any prior claims on the immovable

property.

As a consequence, for determining the applicable LGD* and the required

collateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures, the value of

collateral to be used for this purpose is the market value or mortgage

lending value, as applicable, after being reduced, as appropriate, to take in

particular account of any prior claims on the immovable property.

Subject matter Monitoring and evaluation of mortgages in cases of portfolio-wholesale

transactions

Question

Is it possible to assign the preferential risk weight of 35% according to

Article 125 (1) (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) to exposures that

have been purchased at a wholesale price based on a) samples as to whether

the conditions laid down in Art 208 and 229 CRR are fulfilled and b) a

warranty guaranteeing full compensation in case any of these exposures

default?

Background on the

A credit institution acquired an entire retail portfolio consisting of a large

question

number of mortgage loans. Due to the large number of loans it is assumed to

be impossible to review each and every single loan before the purchase in

order to be able to assess whether the conditions in the abovementioned

provisions have been met. Thus, the credit institution reviewed a sample of

those loans, subsequently leading it to the conclusion that the relevant

preconditions for assigning a 35% RW as set forth in Article 208 and 229

CRR are met. Furthermore, the seller of the portfolio contractually

guaranteed that all of those loans were indeed fulfilling the criteria for

assigning a preferential risk weight and, in the event that individual loans

were to default, pledged to provide full compensation.

4 of 11In effect, the institution considers assigning a preferential risk weight of

35% to be applicable based on the combination of the sample review and the

guarantee. However, it is our legal opinion that the criteria set forth in

Articles 208 and 229 CRR – which are to be adhered to when assigning a RW

of 35% according to Article 125 (1) (c) CRR – basically require an individual

assessment of each and every loan (or, respectively, its terms and

conditions). This is, according to our understanding, also implied by Article

79 CRD IV, which requires institutions “to assess the credit risk of exposures

to individual obligors.”

Furthermore we do not see legal grounds, upon which it seems possible to

“combine” different credit risk mitigation techniques (namely those of a

mortgage and a guarantee) in order to assign a preferential risk weight. It is

thus presumed that the circumstances described above are in breach of the

provisions in question. This notwithstanding, it seems difficult, both in

practical and economic terms, and almost impossible to fulfil the

requirements of those provisions when acquiring entire credit portfolios (at

least in cases where such portfolios are not part of a securitisation

transaction, but are instead individually reflected in the financial

statements).

The purchasing of portfolios is not an uncommon transaction, with the risks

of such transactions are usually partially reflected in the price of the

portfolio (leading not only to risks, but also economic opportunities for the

purchaser) and the acquisition of such portfolios is an important part of

restructuring and resolution processes. We are therefore uncertain as to

whether the provisions above are factually appropriate for such business

activities as well as if there is room to apply them in a proportionate manner.

A proportionate approach might be feasible within the EU in particular, in

the event that the seller is a credit institution that has performed the

abovementioned valuation and monitoring obligations beforehand and the

competent supervisory authority of the jurisdiction of the selling credit

institution did not contest the RW assigned by the selling institution.

Final answer

In order to assign the preferential treatment described in Article 125 (1)(a)

CRR to exposures fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential

property, the conditions described in Article 125 (2)(c) shall be met. With

regard to the requirements in Articles 208 and 229 (1) CRR, in case of

portfolio-wholesale transactions, the purchasing institution needs to ensure

for each purchased loan that the treatment as fully and completely secured

by immovable properties is applied only where such requirements are

met. To ensure that these requirements are met with regard to a portfolio

consisting of a large number of purchased mortgage loans, in case the seller

is an institution that is subject to the requirements of the CRR (or

equivalent), an immediate individual assessment of each purchased loan

would not be necessary, provided that the seller itself had previously

5 of 11complied with the requirements for treating the sold exposures as fully and

completely secured by the immovable properties. In this particular case, the

purchaser would nevertheless have to undertake both an in-depth analysis of

the processes the seller had in place and a review of a representative sample

of the exposures - even if supplemented by a confirmation from the seller’s

supervisor about the loans complying with the requirements. To the extent

that these measures would provide a satisfactory level of assurance of

compliance with the requirements in Articles 208 and 229 (1) CRR the

purchasing institution could continue to treat the exposures as secured by

immovable properties, even before it has fully assessed itself and confirmed

compliance with the relevant requirements on an ongoing basis, and for each

individual loan. Compliance with these requirements should be confirmed by

the purchasing institution without undue delay, following the monitoring

frequency and schedule foreseen in its procedures, or a more ambitious

schedule if this were to achieve earlier compliance with the relevant

requirements. For this purpose, the purchasing institution shall in turn set

up a documented process in order to assess whether or not the requirements

are met for each exposure. As part of this process, the purchasing institution

could also analyse any form of guarantee provided by the seller. The

existence of such guarantee has however no direct incidence on exposure

classification as exposure secured by mortgage on immovable property as

referred to in Article 124 CRR.

Subject matter Risk weighting under standardised approach of an exposure secured by

mortgage on residential property being constructed by the borrower (self-

build) during the period of construction

Question

Where a residential property is being constructed, and the mortgage loan

finances both the construction and subsequent occupation of the property,

and also provided that the loan is at all times fully and completely secured by

the property in its current condition, for risk weighting purposes it is subject

to Article 125 (1) (a) as “residential property which is or shall be occupied or

let by the owner”, further assuming it also complies with the conditions in

paragraph 2 of the Article, would the 35% risk weight apply under that

Article during the construction period as well as during occupation of the

completed property?

Background on the

This query has arisen in the context of self-build mortgages – where a

question

borrower, instead of purchasing an older, or ready built new, property

acquires suitable land and contracts with a builder to construct the house he

or she desires. UK building societies are active providers of finance to this

category, and we believe the same concept is well known, perhaps under

different terminology, in other member states.

A typical self-build project in the UK works like this. The borrower finds a

suitable piece of land, decides exactly what design of house meets the needs

of the family, and obtains planning permission. The borrower usually

contracts with a builder, and/or may provide some or all of the labour

themselves. The lender will finance a proportion of the land costs, with

further advances during the construction period to pay the builder or pay for

materials etc. The loan is therefore always fully secured by the current

property value (and the 80% LTV threshold respected).

The close involvement of the borrower in securing what will be their family's

permanent home ensures a high personal commitment to the project, and to

the loan, compared with a borrower who merely buys a standard ready built

property from a developer. The effective cost of the self-build home is also

7 of 11generally lower, reflecting the absence of developer profit, plus any labour

contribution by the borrower's family. And the personal commitment is

reflected in loss experience which our members indicate is certainly no

worse, and in many instances rather better, than for the residential

mortgage book as a whole. Finally, the self-build model makes a desirable

contribution to the supply of affordable new family housing in the UK.

Our members have generally interpreted Article 125(1) so that the 35% RW

applies throughout the life of the loan. However, another view could be that

during the construction period the loan does not qualify under Article 125 (1)

(a). This view would be based on an read across to Article 4(75), and the

understanding that that definition of “residential property”, implying (though

not stating) that the property is complete, overrides the clear language in

Article 125(1) that contemplates future occupation of a property which may

be under construction.

While the query has arisen in the context of self-build, the interpretation

point cannot be limited to that circumstance. If Article 4(1)(75) is held to

override the words “or shall be” in Article 125(1)(a), then this must apply to

any type of property under construction, including the important category of

loans to charitable housing associations to develop social rented housing for

lower income residents.

We have made extensive enquiries through the European Association of Co-

operative Banks, and found that the majority of EU or EEA member states do

not require that the property must be complete to qualify for the 35% risk

weight. In one instance the NCA even reaffirmed the 35% RW for the

construction phase.

Final answer

By reference to residential property “… which is or shall be occupied or let

by the owner…” Article 125(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR)

allows the application of a risk weight of 35% to residential property under

construction unless otherwise decided by the competent authority in

accordance with Article 124(2) CRR. There is no contradiction between

Article 4(1)(75) and Article 125(1)(a) CRR. The latter provision rather has a

wider scope of application compared to what is defined in Article 4(1)(75)

CRR.

For the avoidance of doubt, the exposure has to be secured by a mortgage on

residential property which “is or shall be occupied or let by the owner”. This

excludes situations where residential property “may” be built in the future

(i.e. mortgages on land) but includes mortgages on building sites on which

residential property will be built for the future owner of the property, or on

8 of 11residential property under construction, provided in both cases that there is

certainty that the owner will occupy or let the property. In this sense, the

35% risk weight cannot be applied to exposures towards real estate

developers. The conditions mentioned in Article 125(2) CRR shall be met,

including those related to legal certainty, documentation and valuation of the

property as set out in Articles 208 and 229(1) CRR. More specifically,

according to Article 125(2)(b), the bank shall carefully assess that the risk of

the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the

underlying property or project but rather on the underlying capacity of the

borrower to repay the debt from other sources, unless the derogation from

this requirement set out in Article 125 (3) of the CRR is applied.

Furthermore, for the purposes of Article 125(2) CRR the market value, in

accordance with Article 4(1)(76) CRR, is the estimated amount for which the

property could be sold on the date of valuation and not on the estimated

value on the date of completion.

This treatment does only apply to exposures fully and completely secured by

mortgages on residential property, and not where units were to be

exploited commercially. For further guidance on residential and commercial

properties, please see Q&A 1214.

Retail exposures that are not secured by a mortgage on residential property

but which comply with the criteria in the first subparagraph of Article 123 of

Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR) shall be assigned a risk weight of 75%.

Additionally, in accordance with Article 124(2)of Regulation (EU) 575/2013

(CRR) the competent or designated authorities shall assess whether the risk-

weight of 35% for exposures secured by mortgages on residential property

located in their territory are appropriate and may set a higher risk weight or

stricter criteria.

Exposures secured by mortgages on residential property which meet the

definition of “speculative immovable property financing” in Article 4(1)(79)

CRR and are therefore assigned to the exposure class for “items associated

with particular high risk” according to Article 128(2)(cd) of Regulation (EU)

575/2013 (CRR) do not qualify for the 35% risk weight.

Subject matter CRR – assignment of preferential risk weight to part of the loan secured by

mortgage

Question

Does expression “part of the loan” refer to gross or net exposure? Which

approach is correct?

Background on the

According to Article 125 (2) (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), the

question

part of the loan to which the 35% risk weight is assigned does not exceed

80% of the market value of the property. e.g. Exposure with gross value = 1

200 000 EUR, credit risk adjustments = 500 000 EUR, net value = 1 200 000

– 500 000 = 700 000 EUR, is secured by real estate with market value = 1

000 000 EUR (80% of market value = 800 000 EUR). Collateral meets all

requirements to enable assignment of preferential risk weight. If Art. 125 2.

(d) refers to net value, then whole exposure (700 000 EUR) is covered by

collateral (800 000 EUR) and might be treated as fully and completely

secured, using preferential risk weight.

Final answer

For the purpose of Article 125(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR),

the part of the loan to which the 35% risk weight is assigned is to be

determined after specific credit risk adjustments (i.e. it should be assigned

to the net exposure).

According to Article 113(2) of CRR, risk weights are applied by multiplying

10 of 11the exposure value by the risk weight. According to Article 111(1) of CRR,

exposure values of asset items, including asset items resulting from a loan,

are determined after specific credit risk adjustments.

Note, however, that one potential indication of an obligor being unlikely to

pay under the definition of default are specific credit risk adjustments

resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to

the institution taking on the exposure (Article 178(3)(b) of CRR). If a default

has occurred in accordance with Article 178, the 35% risk weight is no

longer applicable because in this case Article 127 requires assigning a risk

weight of 100% to the exposure value remaining after specific credit risk

adjustments of exposures fully and completely secured by mortgages on

residential property in accordance with Article 125.

Subject matter Materiality threshold and calculation method for materiality ratio for the

purpose of application of Article 150(1)(c) for types of exposures that are

immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile

Question

A) Can you please clarify whether the 10%/5% threshold to define materiality

for “exposure classes” are valid also as for “types of exposures”? In case not,

can you please specify which thresholds should be considered for the

abovementioned purpose?

B) As for the materiality ratio to be compared against the thresholds can you

please clarify how it should be computed with reference to the following

points:

1. Should the numerator include only the exposures for which the application

for PPU is being sought under Article 150 (1) (c) by excluding exposures for

which PPU has already been granted pursuant other points of Art 150 (1)

1 of 6and exposures not to be included in the calculation of RWA for equity

exposure pursuant to Art. 155 (1) (i.e. Equity exposures risk weighted at

250% in accordance with Art. 48 (4) of Reg. EU 575/2013 and those

deducted from CET1 in accordance with Part Two of Reg. EU 575/2013)?

2. Should the ratio be computed only at solo level or both at solo and

consolidated level, in case an application is limited to only one Legal Entity

(LE) of a Large Group?

Background on the

Pursuant to Article 150(1)(c) a materiality test is required both for “exposure

question

classes” and “types of exposures”. However, Art. 150(2) defines the

materiality test only with reference to “exposure classes”. While an

interpretation of Article 150(2) in terms of “types of exposure” is missing.

Final answer

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does not specify any quantitative

thresholds for determining the materiality of exposures under Article

150(1)(c).

The thresholds defined in Article 150(2) CRR are only applicable to equity

exposures at the exposure class level. The CRR does not specify any

threshold at the lower level of type of exposures, or for any other exposure

class.

For the calculation of the threshold according to Article 150(2) CRR, see

Subject matter Calculation method for materiality ratio to be compared against the 10%/5%

threshold for the purpose of application of Article 150(1)(c) for equity

exposure class (Permanent Partial Use)

Question

How should a credit institution - with the prior permission to apply the

standardised approach permanent partial use (PPU) ex Article 150 CRR for

equity exposures - calculate the threshold as per Article 150(2) CRR?

How is the materiality ratio computed? In particular:

1. Should the numerator include only the exposures for which the

application for PPU is being sought under Article 150(1)(c) CRR by

excluding exposures for which PPU has already been granted

pursuant other points of Article 150(1) and exposures not to be

included in the calculation of RWA for equity exposure pursuant to

Article 155(1) (i.e. Equity exposures risk weighted at 250% in

accordance with Article 48(4) of Reg. EU 575/2013 and those

deducted from CET1 in accordance with Part Two of Reg. EU

575/2013)?

2. Should the ratio be computed only at solo level or both at solo and

consolidated level, in case an application is limited to only one Legal

Entity (LE) of a Large Group?

Background on the

Article 150 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) provides the requirement

question

to include a certain exposure class in the PPU perimeter, by assessing the

relative materiality (generally only exposures deemed as immaterial can be

included in the PPU perimeter). It appears that the evaluation is aimed to

assess the respect of the threshold for an institution that currently uses the

IRB and intends to require the permission to use the standardised (SA)

approach.

Regarding the equity exposure class, Article 150(2) CRR states that ""the

equity exposure class of an institution shall be material if their aggregate

value, excluding equity exposures incurred under legislative programmes as

referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1, does not exceed on average over the

preceding year 10 % of the own funds of the institution. Where the number

of those equity exposures is less than 10 individual holdings, that threshold

shall be 5 % of the own funds of the institution.""

However in point (1)(g) of Article 150 it is stated that ""equity exposures to

entities whose credit obligations are assigned a 0 % risk weight under

Chapter 2 including those publicly sponsored entities where a 0 % risk

weight can be applied"" can be included in the PPU perimeter, without any

3 of 6other requirement to be fulfilled.

In other words, Article 150(2) provides indications whether an equity

exposure class of an institution shall be considered material, in the context

of Article 150(1), introduced within subparagraph 150(1)(c), but it does not

specify whether exposures, for which PPU has already been granted

pursuant to criteria different from the materiality one as per Article

150(1)(c) can be excluded from the calculation of the materiality ratio.

Consequently, potential double counting can arise in the evaluation of the

potential PPU perimeter.

Furthermore, Article 150(2) does not specify whether equity exposures not

subject to RWA calculation according to Article 155 CRR (risk weighted at

250% and those deducted from CET1 in accordance with Part Two of CRR)

should be excluded from the computation.

It follows that it is not clear how a credit institution with the prior

permission to apply the SA (in PPU ex Article 150 CRR) for equity exposures

should calculate the 10% threshold as per Article 150(2) CRR and in

particular :

Whether the amount of equity exposures in the numerator of the ratio

should include all the equity exposures (also the ones deducted ex

Articles 36 and 48 CRR and the ones at 250%RW ex Article 48(4);

Whether 4 instead not 5 quarters should be considered in order to

determine the average for calculating the denominator (i.e. own

funds) of the ratio;

Whether the participation in the capital of a central bank should be

included in the numerator of the ratio;

Whether in case the equity holdings are above the 10% threshold the

institution has to use the AIRB RW (ex Article 155 CRR; not using

anymore the SA ex Article 133 CRR) starting from the same quarter of

the breach (i.e. no possibility to implement a sort of ""plan"" to return to

compliance to remain within the Article 133). In this regard, we can

imagine an example where a bank breaches the 10% threshold in

1Q2019 and in the 2Q2019 the bank manages to fix it returning within

the 10% limit: it is nor clear whether the bank will apply the AIRB RW

for 1Q and again the SA RW for the 2Q or whether there is a sort of

""minimum period"" of application of the AIRB RW or once breached the

10% threshold the bank will lose forever the possibility to apply the

Article 133.

Final answer

Article 150 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) as amended specifies the

conditions an institution must fulfill to ask the competent authority (CA) for

permission the apply the permanent partial use (PPU) to certain exposures.

Article 150(1)(c) CRR indicates that PPU can apply to “exposure classes or

4 of 6types of exposures which are immaterial in terms of size and risk profile”.

Article 150 (2) CRR details the level of materiality to be taken into account

for equity exposures when asking for permission to apply the PPU: “the

equity exposure class of an institution shall be material if their aggregate

value, excluding equity exposures incurred under legislative programs as

referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1, exceeds on average over the

preceding year 10 % of the own funds of the institution” except when the

number of equity exposures is less than 10 individual holdings, in which case

the aforementioned threshold is set at 5%.

According to Article 150(1)(h)CRR, all exposures belonging to the equity

exposure class should be included in the numerator of the materiality

threshold, except equity exposures incurred under legislative programs but

“up to a limit of 10 % of own funds”. It includes therefore all other types of

equity holdings, which are subject to risk weighting, with the exception of

exposures not deducted from the capital but risk weighted at 250% in

accordance with Article 48(4) of the CRR or at 370% in accordance with

Article 471 of the CRR.

Regarding the denominator of the materiality threshold, own funds are to be

computed as stated in CRR Part II of the CRR. “The average over the

preceding year” mentioned in Article 150(2) should be determined as the

average of the 4 last quarters (this includes the quarter that ends at the

respective reporting date for in relation to which the calculation is done), in

order to restrict the effects of the volatility per quarter.

As specified in 150(1) CRR, PPU can only be applied if an institution has

received prior permission by CA. For the exposures described in 150(1)(c),

the CA may authorise the use of PPU for exposures that meet the

“immateriality of exposures” criterion, which for the equity exposure class is

based on an average over the preceding year, as set out in Article 150 (2).

The CRR does not provide for the application of a phase-in period, when the

threshold is reached. Therefore, if the equity holdings are above the 10% or

the 5% threshold, as applicable , the institution shall use the IRB Approach

for the equity exposure class laid down in point (e) of Article 147(2).

For the purposes of the capital requirements on a consolidated level, the

materiality ratio has to be calculated on such consolidated level. Where one

or more subsidiaries have the permission to apply the IRB Approach, the

ratio also has to be computed on the solo level of the subsidiary or

subsidiaries.

Subject matter Definition of “aggregate liabilities” and “total liabilities” in the context of the

5% threshold

Question

Do the terms “aggregated liabilities” and “total liabilities” used in the

calculation of the 5% threshold for multi-currency reporting, refer to on-B/S

liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting framework referring

to Article 24 CRR only or does it include contingent liabilities booked in the

off-B/S as well?

Background on the

This question aims at clarifying the calculation of “aggregated liabilities” and

question

“total liabilities” that are used to define multi-currency reporting obligations.

The off-B/S of banks might contain material (contingent) payment obligations

in currencies other than the reporting currency from derivative business,

guarantees, trade financing as well as non-monetary liabilities from

1 of 4collateral trading. In particular the funding of assets via currency swaps

might imply considerable liquidity risk.

However, outflows from off-B/S liabilities might be uncertain and in

derivative business – subject to net settlement – the underlying notional

might not entail an outflow. Therefore the consideration of off-B/S liabilities

in the calculation of “aggregated liabilities” and “total liabilities” would

require the definition of selection rules and conversion factors.

Final answer

If a term is not defined in the Regulation, the Q&A instrument cannot be

used to provide a formal, legal definition. Non-defined terms must be

interpreted according to the general meaning of the terms used, together

with other recognised interpretative methods, such as contextual

interpretation and by identifying the objective of the concerned provisions.

In view of the wording of Article 4(5)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation

(EU) 2015/61, it is clear that the two terms of “aggregate liabilities” and

“total liabilities” only refer to on-balance sheet items.

Subject matter Assigning Specific Credit Risk Adjustments for a group of exposures to the

exposures within the group

Question

Following question 2013_499, could you confirm that this implies that the

collective provisions allocated to specific portfolios for accounting purposes

(FINREP) will agree at aggregate level with the amounts booked in the

financial statements but the allocation for RWA to single exposures will

differ from the allocation for accounting purposes to single exposures and

thus a single exposure will show a different collective provision for

accounting purposes (FINREP) than that for RWA?

Background on the

The reason behind this question is during audits (supervisory or otherwise) it

question

is expected that the COREP provision of RWA should be in line with the

accounting provision allocation. See also Q&A 2013_499 and Q&A 2013_201.

Final answer

Article 2(1) of the Regulation (EU) No. 183/2014 states that when a Specific

Credit Risk Adjustment reflects losses related to the credit risk of a group of

exposures, they should be assigned to all single exposures of the group

proportionally to the risk-weighted exposure amounts (see also Q&A

2013_499). On the other hand, collective impairment allowances should be

proportionally allocated among group assets for FINREP templates F 04.04

and F 07.00 (see also Q&A 2013_201). Consequently, the allocation of

collective impairment allowances to single exposures for calculation of

capital requirement for credit risk might differ from the allocation for

FINREP purposes.

Published as final Q&A 21/02/2025

1 of 24Subject matter Own secured debt issues in Top 10 - C71.00

Question

Does the secured debt instruments issued by the reporting institution (own

issues retained) be reported in the Top10 in C71?

Background on the

It is clear that own-covered bonds and own-ABS, meaning secured debt

question

instruments issued by the reporting institution retained on the institution’s

balance sheet and to which the institution has direct access at its level of

consolidation (regardless of whether they are CB-eligible, and reagrdless of

whether they are pre-positioned at a central bank for standard liquidity

operations) are part of the Counterbalancing capacity to be included both in

C66 and C71. But the issuer being the same as the reporting institution, it is

not clear whether these assets could be reported as one of the top 10 issuers

(to the extent that these assets fall under the top 10 issuers), or whether

they should be reported always in Row 120 (2. ALL OTHER ITEMS USED AS

COUNTERBALANCING CAPACITY), leaving the top 10 for third party

issuers/counterparties.

Final answer

According to Annex XXI of Regulation (EU) 2021/451 – ITS on supervisory

reporting, point 1, template C 71.00 'collects information about the reporting

institutions’ concentration of counterbalancing capacity by the ten largest

holdings of assets or liquidity lines granted to the institution'. In addition,

point 3 clarifies that the 'counterbalancing capacity in C 71.00 shall be the

same as that in C 66.01'. Point 6 further clarifies that 'concentrations of

counterbalancing capacity with a central bank as issuer or counterparty shall

not be reported in this template' as individual issuer.

Given the above, to the extent that the secured debt instruments issued by

the reporting institution and retained are part of the counterbalancing

capacity of the institution (e.g. they fall into the scope of C 66.01 reporting -

initial stock - column 0010), the institution falls under the top 10 issuers and

the instruments are unencumbered to be available for the institution to

convert into cash on the reporting reference date, then the reporting

institution shall be reported as the issuer of such instruments for the

purpose of C 71.00. The product type to be reported would be the type of

secured debt instruments that have been retained, in line with point 2 of

Annex XXI.

Subject matter Temporary unavailable (blocked) deposits

Question

Could you please clarify how temporary unavailable (blocked) deposits

should be presented?

Background on the

Customer deposits can be temporary unavailable for owner due to more

question

reasons:

missing documentation,

blocked by Court, Tax authorities, the other financial institutions,

suppliers,

client is in OFAC list, etc.

In which positions in F1.2 and F.8.1 these deposits should be presented:

1. Deposits,

2. Other Financial liabilities, or

3. Non-financial liabilities.

Liabilities are defined in accordance with Annex V Part I, section 5.3:

35. Financial liabilities shall be distributed among the following classes of

instruments: ‘Derivatives’, ‘Short positions’, ‘Deposits’, ‘Debt securities

issued’ and ‘Other financial liabilities’.

36. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘deposits’

shall be deposits as defined in the Table of Part 2 of Annex II to the ECB BSI

Regulation.

38. ‘Other financial liabilities’ shall include all financial liabilities other than

3 of 24derivatives, short positions, deposits and debt securities issued.

41. ‘Other financial liabilities’ shall also include dividends to be paid,

amounts payable in respect of suspense and transit items, and amounts

payable in respect of future settlements of transactions in securities or

foreign exchange transactions where payables for transactions are

recognised before the payment date.

and Part II, section 1.2:

13. Liabilities that are not financial liabilities and that due to their nature

could not be classified in specific balance sheet items shall be reported in

‘Other liabilities’.

Also, Deposits categories are in accordance with the Table of Part 2 of Annex

II to the ECB BSI Regulation split in to:

Overnight deposits,

Deposits with agreed maturity,

Deposits redeemable at notice, and

Repos.

If these deposits can be considered as suspense, then based on Annex V they

should be presented as Other financial liabilities.

From the other side, if these deposits can be considered as subject to

restrictions according to national practice, then they should be present as

Deposit, with category Deposits redeemable at notice.

At the end, from our point of view classification to Other liabilities can’t be

met, due the fact that these deposits are in accordance with IAS 32, under

definition of financial instruments, and also they can be classified in specific

balance sheet.

Also, even this question isn’t subject of FINREP reporting, we would like to

clarify with you can they be present in more time bucket of Contractual Flow

Maturity in C66.01 – Maturity Ladder? Based on Table of Part 2 of Annex II

to the ECB BSI Regulation they can be in more time buckets which are ‘up to

and including three months’.

Table of Part 2 of Annex II to the ECB BSI Regulation, 9.3. Deposits

redeemable at notice: ”Non-transferable deposits without any agreed

maturity which cannot be converted into currency without a period of prior

notice; before the expiry the conversion into currency is not possible or

possible only with a penalty. They include deposits which, although perhaps

legally withdrawable on demand, would be subject to penalties and

restrictions according to national practice (classified in the maturity band

‘up to and including three months’), and investment accounts without period

of notice or agreed maturity, but which contain restrictive drawing

4 of 24provisions (classified in the maturity band ‘over three months’).

Final answer

In accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)

2021/451 (ITS), Annex V, Part 1, paragraph 36, ‘deposits’ shall be deposits

as defined in the Table of Part 2 of Annex II to the ECB BSI Regulation. In

table of Part 2 of Annex II to the ECB BSI Regulation, deposits are split into

the following categories:

Overnight deposits,

Deposits with agreed maturity,

Deposits redeemable at notice, and

Repos.

ECB BSI Regulation states that the classification of financial liabilities as

deposits should be based on an assessment of their characteristics, including

transferability, convertibility, certainty, and negotiability, as well as their

terms of issue, as defined within the Regulation.

Deposits with temporary unavailability due to reasons such as: missing

documentation; deposits blocked by Court, Tax authorities, the other

financial institutions, suppliers; client in OFAC list, etc. still have the

characteristics of deposit based on contract with the client. Therefore, they

should be reported as deposits in templates F 01.02 and F 08.01 in the row

corresponding to the type of deposit: Current accounts/ overnight deposits,

Deposits with agreed maturity, Deposits redeemable at notice or Repos.

With respect to determining the contractual maturity of flows, for C 66.01

reporting, according to Annex 23 of ITS on supervisory reporting,

institutions shall report the flows from deposit according to the residual

maturity.

Subject matter FINREP Template F01.01

Question

We would like to seek clarification regarding the classification of repurchase

agreements (repos) in the context of the FINREP reporting framework.

Specifically, we am inquiring whether repurchase agreements with a

maturity of less than or equal to one day, where the counterparty is a credit

institution, can be reported under row 0040 (Other demand deposits) in

report F01.01.

Background on the

In the process of preparing our FINREP reports, we have encountered a

question

classification question regarding short-term repurchase agreements (repos)

with credit institutions. Specifically, we are reviewing the appropriate

categorization of repos with a maturity of one day or less within the F01.01

report structure.

Our current understanding of the FINREP framework suggests that such

short-term repos might potentially be classified under row 0040 (Other

demand deposits) in report F01.01. However, given the specific nature of

repo transactions and their importance in liquidity management, we want to

ensure we are applying the correct classification methodology in line with

regulatory expectations.

Question: We respectfully request clarification on whether repurchase

agreements meeting the following criteria can be reported under row 0040

(Other demand deposits) in report F01.01:

1. The repo has a maturity of less than or equal to one day

2. The counterparty is a credit institution

Additionally, if this classification is not appropriate, we would greatly

appreciate guidance on the correct reporting category for such short-term

repos within the FINREP framework.

Final answer

According to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (ITS),

Annex V, Part 2, paragraph 85, letter e): 'Reverse repurchase loans’ shall

include finance granted in exchange for securities or gold bought under

repurchase agreements or borrowed under securities lending agreements as

defined in paragraphs 183 and 184 of this Part'

According to the ITS, Annex V, part 2, paragraphs 183 and 184: ‘Repurchase

agreements’ (‘repos’) shall be transactions in which the institution receives

6 of 24cash in exchange for financial assets sold at a given price under a

commitment to repurchase the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a

specified future date [....]. Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) and ‘reverse

repurchase loans’ (‘reverse repos’) shall involve cash received or loaned out

by the institution'.

Under IFRS, a repo transaction does not lead to the derecognition of the

financial asset provided as collateral, but a repo liability (debt) is accounted

for by the reporting institution in counterparty of the cash received

(representing the obligation to reimburse the cash). A repo transaction does

not lead to the recognition of a repo asset.

Consistently with the definition and the accounting treatment of repo

transaction, under a reverse-repo transaction, the reporting institution loans

cash in exchange for financial assets bought at a given price under a

commitment to resell the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a

specified future date. In this transaction, the reporting institution accounts

for a loan on the basis of the cash amount lent.

In template F 05.01, there is an ad-hoc row 0050 where all reverse repo

transactions shall be reported, regardless of the maturity and the

counterparty. Therefore, these transactions should not be reported in row

0010 of F 05.01.

Consistently with this approach, in template F 01.01, the reverse repo

transactions should be reported as 'loan' in the relevant accounting portfolio

following the applicable accounting rules, outside the row 0040 'Other

demand deposits'. Indeed, the reverse repo transactions do not match the

definition of 'other demand deposits' in Commission Implementing

Regulation (EU) 2021/451, Annex V, part 2, paragraph 3 that are 'loans and

advances that are balances receivable on demand with credit institutions'.

Subject matter Reporting of customer portfolios managed on a discretionary basis

Question

According to Annex V, Part 2, paragraph 285 (a) of Commission

Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (ITS): '‘'Asset management’ shall

refer to assets belonging directly to the customers, for which the institution

is providing management.” Since these assets belong to the customers, they

are generally not recognized in the balance sheet of the credit institution. It

is not clear however if the cash deposited by customers that the institution

manages on a discretionary basis should be recognized as a liability.

Additionally, if this account would have a negative balance, an asset might

be recognized.

Background on the

Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) offers additional

question

details related to the FinRep reporting for the institutions in Luxembourg

where it is stated: “cash deposited by customers that the institution manages

on a discretionary basis is registered in the balance sheet liabilities (table F

1.2: Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: deposits).” (document

“Additional guidance for Credit Institutions related to specific reporting

aspects”,

https://www.cssf.lu/en/Document/additional-guidance-for-credit-institutions-r

elated-to-specific-reporting-aspects/)

It is not clear if this requirement is country specific or if according to IFRS

and EBA requirements, these items must be recognized in the balance sheet

of the credit institution which manages the customer portfolios on a

discretionary basis.

Final answer

Cash deposited by customers that the institution manages on a discretionary

basis should be reported in Finrep template F 01.02, row 0120 (financial

liabilities measured at amortised cost: deposits), provided that they meet the

recognition criteria as ‘financial liability measured at amortised cost’ in

accordance with the applicable accounting framework and they meet the

definition of ‘deposits’ in the Table of Part 2 of Annex II to the Regulation

Subject matter Direct contributions to reserves from shareholders

Question

Which conditions should direct contributions to reserves from shareholders

meet when assessing their conformity with the criteria contained in the last

subparagraph of Article 26(1) CRR?

Background on the

Apart from capital increase, in order to increase the equity of an institution,

question

in some jurisdictions, it is possible for shareholders to make direct

contributions to the reserves of the institutions.

The economic outcome of a direct contribution to the reserves of a credit

institution is similar to that of a capital increase: an increase in CET1 items.

Nevertheless, because reserves are not a capital instrument, a contribution

in this form does not need to meet the authorisation/notification requirement

of article 26(3) CRR that is necessary in order to be classified as CET1, nor

the eligibility conditions of article 28 CRR or the supervisory permission to

reduce own funds of articles 77 and 78 CRR.

9 of 24To ensure that the funds are available to the institution for unrestricted and

immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur according to

Article 26(1) CRR, direct contributions to reserves should be subject to

certain conditions.

Final answer

Where permitted under national law, direct contributions to reserves may be

recognised as CET1, as long as they meet the requirements of the last

subparagraph of Article 26(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR),

namely that they are available to the institution for unrestricted and

immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur.

The use of direct contributions to reserves should be approached prudently,

as it is not meant to be the primary method to raise capital. The potential use

of such measure is expected to be subject to similar conditions, as listed

under the paragraph below, to those of CET1 instruments, and under the

same level of competent authority scrutiny.

In this regard, when assessing the conformity of those contributions with the

criteria contained in the last subparagraph of Article 26(1) CRR, competent

authorities should take into account the following criteria, which can be

adapted by taking into account the specificities of each case and the

applicable national legislation:

a) The contribution should be made to offset losses or as an explicit equity

contribution.

b) It should be made as a non-refundable contribution.

c) If there are several shareholders, it is generally expected that all make

contributions in proportion to their share in the capital of the institution.

Exceptions should be scrutinised and duly justified. There should not be any

agreement according to which a disproportionate contribution leads to a

preferential treatment in case the reserve is dissolved.

d) The contribution should be evidenced as fully paid up at the time of its

realisation, under the same conditions as share capital, and the contribution

should not be funded directly or indirectly by the institution. Contributions in

kind should fulfil the criteria specified in Q&A 3636.

e) There should not be any direct or indirect economic benefits of any kind to

the contributor or any other person for the contribution made (e.g.

dividends, interest, remuneration, servicing cost, etc).

f) The provisions governing or documentation formalising the contribution

should indicate expressly that, in accordance with the last subparagraph of

Article 26(1) CRR, the amounts contributed are available to the institution

for unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these

occur.

10 of 24g) Contributions should be classified as equity for the purposes of

determining balance sheet insolvency, where applicable under national

insolvency law.

h) Contributions should be accounted for as reserves within equity, in

accordance with the applicable accounting framework.

i) The institution should provide sufficient disclosure of such an item in its

public accounts.

j) The contributor should not be entitled to any right on the profits and

reserves in any situation including in the event of the institution’s insolvency

or liquidation.

k) All the above requirements should be documented in a legal form similar

to the one used for increases of CET1 instruments taking into account the

local legal framework. For contributions in kind, similar documentation can

also include an independent auditor’s valuation.

l) Any reclassification of the contribution to another reserve and/or

distribution should be subject to prior consultation with the competent

authority.

Subject matter Conditions for increasing the margin period of risk (MPOR) used for the

11 of 24exposure value of netting sets with margin agreements.

Question

Article 285 paragraph 3(b) references “OTC derivative that cannot be easily

replaced”. By definition “OTC derivative” does not include listed / exchange

trades derivatives. The final sentence of paragraph 3 states “An institution

shall consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are

concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the

market precipitously whether the institution would be able to replace those

trades or securities.” Is this is a clarification of 3(b) meaning that the

reference to “replace those trades” would be in relation to OTC derivatives?

Or alternatively is the reference to “replace those trades” broader than OTC

derivatives?

Background on the

Article 285 paragraph 3 requires that the margin period of risk be increased

question

in certain scenarios. Point (b) of paragraph 3 includes the requirement to

increase the MPOR if the netting set contains an “OTC derivative that cannot

be easily replaced”. By definition “OTC derivative” does not include listed /

exchange trades derivatives, as a result the assessment of “cannot be easily

replaced” required in 3(b) is limited in scope to OTC derivatives.

whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a

particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market

precipitously whether the institution would be able to replace those trades or

securities.” It is unclear whether this is a clarification of 3(b) meaning the

reference to “replace those trades” would be in relation to OTC derivatives

or alternatively whether the reference to “replace those trades” is broader

than OTC derivatives?

Final answer

Article 285(3), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR) states that for

netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral,

or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the margin period of

risk shall not be less than 20 business days.

In relation to OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced, the second

subparagraph of Article 285(3) of the CRR specifies that an institution shall

determine whether OTC derivatives cannot be easily replaced in the context

of stressed market conditions, characterised by the absence of continuously

active markets where a counterparty would, within two days or fewer, obtain

multiple price quotations that would not move the market or represent a

price reflecting a premium.

The last subparagraph of Article 285(3) of the CRR clarifies that institutions

shall consider whether OTC derivatives referred to in point (b) and in the

12 of 24second subparagraph are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if

that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution

would be able to replace those trades. In this regard, since point (b) and the

second subparagraph of Article 285(3) of the CRR mention only OTC

derivatives as derivative types, within the trades referred to in the last

subparagraph to the extent these are derivatives, only OTC derivatives are

meant.

Note however that Article 285(3), point (b), of the CRR also refers to netting

sets containing one or more trades involving illiquid collateral as e.g.

securities financing transactions, and the last subparagraph of Article 285(3)

of the CRR requires an institution to consider whether the securities it holds

as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that

counterparty exited the market precipitously, whether the institution would

be able to replace those securities. Accordingly, and due to point (b) of

Article 285(3) of the CRR, netting sets with trades involving illiquid collateral

or collateral concentrated in a particular counterparty which would not allow

to replace the securities if that counterparty exited the market precipitously,

should also be subject to the minimum margin period of risk of 20 business

days.

Subject matter Application of article 378 for free delivery transactions

13 of 24Question

Given the requirements of article 378 and 379 CRR II, shall the institution

apply the article 378 also in case of free deliveries (disciplined by article

379) or should it be applied only to DVP transactions?

Background on the

While article 379 is clearly applicable to the free delivery transactions when

question

an outstanding payment occurred at the reference period, it is not clear

whether the article 378 shall be applied as well since it is not specified the

type of transaction (DVP or free delivery).

Let’s assume a free delivery FX Forward USD buy/EUR sell where the

institution has paid EUR with settlement date 27/03 but we did not receive

the USD amount agreed from the counterparty at expected settlement date

28/03. At the end of march (reporting date 31/03) the transaction is still

unsettled and an appreciation of the USD occurs.

Hence, according to the article 379, it is required to calculate own funds

requirement treating the free delivery unsettled as an exposure resulting

from i) “the value transferred to the counterparty” and ii) the difference

between strike price and spot price (“current positive exposure”).

Let’s suppose that the transaction is still unsettled at the end of April

(reporting date 30/04) and a further appreciation of USD occurred: the

above exposures i) and ii) shall be treated applying a 1250% risk weight or,

alternatively, deducted from Common Equity Tier 1.

Because of the exposure under article 379 already embeds the difference

between the agreed settlement price and its current market value (a loss for

the institution), the application of article 378 seems to be a duplication of

capital requirements from settlement risk.

Final answer

In accordance with Article 378 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), in the

case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies

and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or

commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled

after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price

difference to which it is exposed. The price difference is calculated as the

difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument,

equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market

value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.

This defined price difference implies that the institution has not made its

payment for debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies or commodities

before receiving them, while the institution remains exposed to the

mentioned price difference, which should be capitalised in accordance with

Article 378 CRR.

14 of 24On the contrary, in accordance with Article 379 of the CRR a transaction

qualifies as a free delivery if the institution has paid for securities, foreign

currencies or commodities before receiving them, or it has delivered

securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving payment for

them.

It follows that transactions that qualify as free deliveries in accordance with

Article 379 CRR are not expected to be subject to own funds requirements

for settlement/delivery risk set out in Article 378 CRR. Nevertheless,

transactions that fall under Article 379 of the CRR should be subject to

capital requirements for both the value transferred plus the current positive

exposure, as envisaged by paragraph 3 of Article 379 of the CRR.

In addition, neither Article 378 nor Article 379 mention delivery-versus-

payment (DvP) transactions or non-delivery-versus-payment (non-DvP)

transactions, hence these transactions should be subject to those Articles

depending on whether they meet their respective requirements. In this

regard, while DvP transactions may not be expected to qualify as free

deliveries and be subject to Article 379 CRR thanks to their settlement

mechanism which should ensure the simultaneous exchange of the payment

for the asset to be received, non-DvP transactions could fall under Article

378 of the CRR in case the institution did not yet make its payment or

delivery to the counterparty, and the transaction is still unsettled after its

due delivery date.

Subject matter Seniority categories to use when offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short

exposures and long exposures within the DRC calculations for non-

securitisations

Question

Which set of seniority categories shall be utilised and how should they be

ranked as the basis for offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short exposures

and long exposures within the DRC calculations for non-securitisations?

Background on the

Pursuant to CRR Article 325x(1) on the net jump-to-default amounts within

question

the DRC calculations for non-securitisations, the gross JTD amounts of short

and long exposures to the same obligor may be offset when the short

exposures have the same seniority as, or lower seniority than, the long

exposures. Yet, this CRR Article does not specify which set of seniority

categories shall be utilised as the basis for the offsetting.

It seems that a parallel can be drawn with the seniority categories already

used for the assignment of LGDs to the exposures (specified in CRR Articles

325w(3) & 325w(6)) that are prescribed for calculating the gross JTD

amounts set out in CRR Articles 325w(1) & (2). That interpretation would

imply using the same seniority categories also for the offsetting in the

context of Article 325x(1), namely: non-senior, senior, covered bond and

equity.

The ranking of the seniority should be done according to the LGD values

assigned to the categories, e.g. the category with lowest LGD value ranks

highest in the seniority. However, non-senior should rank higher than equity

although the same LGD is applied.

Final answer

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does not prescribe the level of

granularity at which the seniority of positions is to be assessed in the context

of the DRC calculations for non-securitisations. However, a set of categories

is used for a similar purpose in the context of Article 325w CRR.

Subject matter Basis of calculation for the DRC for non-securitisations and SBM-CSR for

non-securitisations – Individual ‘issuers’/‘obligors’ or ‘group of

issuers/obligors’?

Question

Do the calculations of the DRC for non-securitisations and SBM-CSR for non-

securitisations have to be based on the individual ‘issuers’/‘obligors’, or

could these calculations alternatively be based on the concept of a ‘group of

issuers/obligors’ consisting of e.g. a conglomerate (and e.g. represented by

an ‘ultimate parent’ corresponding to the ‘head of group’ or ‘parent

company’)?

Background on the

For the purpose of FRTB ASA calculation, the terms issuer and obligor

question

express the same concept and are used interchangeably, both referring to

the legal entity issuing the instrument or to the legal entity to which an

instrument refers. As to the DRC for non-securitisations, CRR Article 325v(1)

defines short and long exposures in reference to “[…] the default of an issuer

or group of issuers […]”. This wording might seem to suggest that the

‘ultimate parent’ could also play a role in the DRC for non-securitisations.

Yet, the CRR Articles specific to the DRC for non-securitisations (i.e. Articles

325w till 325y) solely mention the term ‘issuer’/‘obligor’. Consequently, the

term ‘group of issuers’ within the definitions in the general Article 325v(1)

does not seem to apply to the non-securitisation case.

As to the SBM-CSR for non-securitisations, CRR Article 325m(1) states that

“[t]he delta credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-

securitisation instruments that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the

issuer credit spread rates of those instruments [applying] one risk factor per

issuer and maturity”. The calculation shall therefore be based on individual

‘issuers’/‘obligors’, and not on e.g. a ‘group of issuers/obligors’.

Final answer

17 of 24In accordance with the wording of Article 325m of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR) and Articles 325w to 325x CRR, respectively, the calculation

of the own funds requirements on the basis of the sensitivity based method

and of the own funds requirements for default risk for non-securitisations

under the alternative standardised approach is based on the individual

‘issuers’/‘obligors’, i.e. based on the legal entity issuing the instrument or the

legal entity that the instrument refers to. The calculation of those own funds

requirements for non-securitisations should not be based on an alternative

concept such as a ‘group of issuers/obligors’.

Subject matter Basis of calculation for the DRC for non-securitisations and SBM-CSR for

non-securitisations - instruments guaranteed by a guarantor

Question

In the case of instruments guaranteed by a guarantor (such as guaranteed

bonds), can that guarantor be used as the basis for calculating the DRC for

non-securitisations and the SBM-CSR for non-securitisations?

Background on the

The CRR does not specify whether the ‘issuer’/‘obligor’ may be replaced by a

question

guarantor in the case where an instrument is not guaranteed by a guarantor,

for either DRC for non-securitisations or SBM-CSR for non-securitisations.

Unlike the CRR, the Basel framework for DRC for non-securitisations allows

18 of 24issuers to be replaced by guarantors under certain conditions. In particular,

MAR 22.19(2) specifies that the credit risk mitigation requirements in CRE

22.71 and CRE 22.73 apply in determining whether a guaranteed bond is an

exposure to the underlying obligor or an exposure to the guarantor. While

these DRC specific Basel provisions have not been incorporated into the

CRR, a similar concept could be found with credit risk mitigation provisions

in the CRR are set out in Art. 213(1) and 215(1) CRR. For CSR, no such

possibility of replacing the issuer with a guarantor is provided for in the

Basel framework.

Final answer

In the context of the calculation of the own funds requirements on the basis

of the sensitivity-based method for credit spread risk classes in accordance

with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 1a, Section 2, of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR), it is not permitted to replace the issuer with a third party

guaranteeing the instrument issued by that issuer. In the context of the

calculation of the own funds requirement for default risk in accordance with

Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 1a, Section 5, CRR, the obligor of a guaranteed

instrument may be replaced by its guarantor, if the requirements for credit

risk mitigation referred to in Article 213(1) and Article 215(1) CRR are met.

Subject matter Vega general interest rate risk and credit spread risk factors

19 of 24Question

For credit instruments that include issuer-specific optionality, do both

general interest rate vega and credit spread vega risk factors need to be

considered as part of the SBM?

Background on the

Credit instruments such as callable bonds, options on (sovereign) bond

question

futures, and bond options are sensitive to changes in the implied volatilities

of the underlying's issuer credit spread rates. These instruments can be

affected by two types of vega risk factors: general interest rate risk (GIRR)

vega and credit spread risk (CSR) vega. The GIRR vega captures the

sensitivity of the instrument's value to changes in the volatility of the general

interest rate, while the CSR vega captures the sensitivity to changes in the

volatility of the issuer's credit spread.

The sensitivity-based method (SBM) outlined in Article 325m(2) of the CRR

requires institutions to calculate risk sensitivities for market risk own funds

requirements. However, it is not explicitly clear how to treat instruments

that are sensitive to both GIRR and CSR when only a single volatility surface

is used for pricing purposes. This single volatility surface may encapsulate

both general market and issuer-specific volatility effects, leading to a

question of whether separate vega sensitivities for GIRR and CSR should be

calculated or whether a single vega sensitivity can be used for both.

In this context, FAQ5 related to MAR 21.8 of the Basel framework clarifies

that for callable bonds, options on sovereign bond futures and bond options,

delta, vega and curvature capital requirements must be computed for both

GIRR and CSR.

Final answer

Where an instrument includes issuer-specific optionality, both the GIRR and

CSR vega sensitivities must be included in the calculation of the own funds

requirements for market risks on the basis of the sensitivity-based method in

accordance with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 1a, Section 2, of Regulation

(EU) No 575/2013 (CRR). This applies even if the institution uses a single

risk factor for vega risk.

Subject matter Treatment of deposits pledged as collateral against loans in c66.01

Question

How should deposits pledged as collateral against loans be reported in

c66.01?

Background on the

According to the applicable instructions for row 0260 (section “Outflows”) of

question

c66.01 (Reg. (EU) 2021/451 Annex XXIII), deposits received as collateral are

exempted from this row. This is also reflected in the label of the row.

From the instructions, it is unclear whether the relevant outflow of these

deposits (at the maturity date of the loan against which the collateral is

provided) should be reported in a different row or be excluded from the

maturity ladder scope. In our view, the outflow should be reported,

otherwise there would be a mismatch due to the expected inflow from the

collection of the loan and the zero corresponding outflow of the deposit. This

approach would be in line with the conservative treatment described in par.

12 of the applicable instructions, where rules are provided for the allocation

of the outflows arising from all types of deposits. As regards the row where

this outflow should be reported, there are two options: i) the relevant

amount shall be netted against the inflow from the collection of the loan (in

the relevant row of item 2.2 “Monies due not reported in 2.1 resulting from

loans and advances granted to” or ii) the relevant amount shall be reported

in row 0370 “Other outflows” given that they do not fall into any of the other

available rows.

Final answer

In accordance with point 6 of the Annex XXIII of the Commission

Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451, the section entitled ‘Outflows and

inflows’ of the template C 66.01 shall cover future contractual cash flows

from all on- and off- balance sheet items pursuant to contracts valid at the

reporting date.

According to the instructions for row 0370 of that template, cash outflows

21 of 24not reported in items 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5 shall be reported there.

Therefore, outflows from the return of deposits received as collateral, at the

expiry of the collateralized transaction, shall be reported in row 0370,

provided they meet the criteria stated in point 6.

Question

For entities which are consolidated as part of the Group, where a subsidiary

of the economic group has legal ownership over these entities, but the group

has no legal ownership over that subsidiary. What data should be reported in

FINREP template F 40.02?

Background on the

Annex V. Part 2 Paragraph 294 states that institutions shall provide, as of the

question

reporting date, detailed information on subsidiaries, joint ventures and

associates fully or proportionally consolidated within the scope of accounting

consolidation as well as entities reported as “Investments in subsidiaries,

22 of 24And following your final answer under the question submitted by Nationwide

accordance with the accounting rules but the reporting entity does not have

the legal ownership, the entities shall be reported in template F 40.01 and no

information shall be reported in template F 40.02. Therefore, it is possible to

identify the entities controlled by the group of institutions but not who the

controlling entity is.

Our question refers to the subsidiaries under the controlled entity, where

there is legal ownership. In this case, there is a direct capital investment by

the controlled entity in the subsidiary, but there is no legal ownership of the

group’s parent company. Should this subsidiary be included as the Parent

Company in FINREP template 40.02? (for example: Parent company A has

control over entity B, and entity B has legal ownership over entity C. Should

the relationship between entities B and C be reported on FINREP template

40.02?)

Final answer

Paragraph 294 of Part 2 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation

(EU) 2021/451 states that: ‘Institutions shall provide, as of the reporting

date, detailed information on subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates fully

or proportionally consolidated within the scope of accounting consolidation

as well as entities reported as ‘Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures

and associates’ in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Part, including those

entities in which investments are held for sale under IFRS 5. All entities shall

be reported, regardless of the activity they perform’.

In the example above mentioned, the entities are consolidated in accordance

with the accounting rules and the subsidiary of the reporting entity (entity B)

have the legal ownership over entity C which is also a subsidiary of the

group. Therefore, the entities B and C should be reported in both template F

40.01 and F 40.02. In the latter, the relationship between entity B and entity

C should be reported. Therefore, entity B will be identified as ‘holding

company’ and entity C as the 'investee'. Columns ‘Security code’,

‘Accumulated equity interest (%)’, ‘Carrying amount’ and ‘Acquisition cost’

should correspond to the security/securities held by entity B in entity C,

Subject matter CCR treatment of exposures arising from centrally cleared transactions -

indirect clearing flows

Question

Does an institution which is a client of a clearing member or a lower-level

client in a multi-level client structure (institution > intermediary/higher-level

client > clearing member > central counterparty) need to verify that Art.

305 (2) or (3) conditions are met at every level of the structure to apply Art.

306 (1) CRR, which might also entail zeroing out the exposure value arising

from the transaction between the institution and the clearing member or the

higher-level client if the institution is acting as a financial intermediary

between a client and a CCP?

Guidance is sought on 4 possible clearing flows:

Indirect clearing flows (clients’ transactions and institution’s own

transactions)

1 of 71. Client > institution > clearing member > CCP

2. Institution > clearing member > CCP

Multi-level indirect clearing flows (clients’ transactions and institution’s own

transactions)

3. Client > institution > intermediary/higher-level client > clearing

member > CCP

4. Institution > intermediary/higher-level client > clearing member >

CCP

Background on the

Interplay between Article 305 and Article 306 CRR – EAD/RWAs

question

According to Article 305 (2), an institution which is a client may calculate the

own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions

with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306 provided that all the

conditions (a to d) set out therein are met (segregation and bankruptcy

remoteness, portability, legal review and QCCP).

According to Article 305 (3) where an institution that is a client fails to meet

the condition set out in point (a) of paragraph 2, it may calculate the own

funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with

its clearing member in accordance with Article 306, subject to replacing the

2 % risk weight set out in point (a) of Article 306(1) with a 4 % risk weight.

According to Article 305 (4), in the case of a multi-level client structure, an

institution that is a lower-level client accessing the services of a CCP through

a higher-level client may apply the treatment set out in Article 305 (2) or (3)

only where the conditions set out therein are met at every level of that

structure.

Based on the provisions above, it seems that an institution that is either a

client of a clearing member or a higher-level client, must first look at Article

305 before it can apply the provisions set out in Article 306.

However, in the case of a clearing flow involving clients’ transactions (1 and

3 above), the institution acts as a financial intermediary, hence it could be

argued that the institution could calculate its own funds requirements by

applying Article 306 directly.

Final answer

According to Article 305(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), in the

case of a multi-level client structure, an institution that is a lower-level client

accessing the services of a CCP through a higher-level client may apply the

treatment set out in Article 305(2) or (3) of the CRR only where the

conditions set out therein are met at every level of that structure.

This should apply also to the case of a clearing flow involving clients’

transactions, where the institution acts as a financial intermediary, i.e. the

2 of 7institution should verify that Article 305(2) or (3) safeguards are met at

every level of the structure before applying Article 306(1) of the CRR.

On the 4 possible clearing flows, the application of Art. 305(4) of the CRR to

the proposed examples is as follows (always from the perspective of

the institution):

1. Client > institution > clearing member > CCP

EADs/RWAs:

Client leg: bilateral exposure and client’s risk weight (RW)

Clearing member leg:

Subject matter Interaction between Qualified CCPs and Reporting

Question

Institutions must meet higher capital requirements as long as CCPs are not

qualified. Most of the Clearing organisations are working for many years on

the derivative market. Will EBA (or national competent authorities) create an

interim agreement for that special issue? CCPs are already supervised by

their national financial authorities.

Background on the

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR – EU 575/2013) differentiates

question

between ‘qualified’ and ‘non-qualified’ Central Counterparties. A ‘Qualified

Central Counterparty’ needs to be authorised by ESMA, related to article 14

of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR – EU 648/2013) or

– in case of third-country CCPs – they will be accepted under Article 25 of

EMIR. Otherwise a Central Counterparty is a ‘non-qualified CCP’. ESMA has

informed that there is no authorised Central Counterparty in Europe, and

they do not expect authorisations until 1Q 2014. From an institution's point

of view is it very important to manage their trade exposures by ‘Qualified

CCPs’ because those circumstances have an impact on the capital

requirements of institutions. If an institution transacts a derivative by a

5 of 7‘Qualified CCP’, the derivative will have a risk weight of two per cent – in

relation to Article 306 (1)(a) of CRR. Is the CCP ‘non-qualified’, the credit

risk will be calculated accordingly to Article 107 (2 b) CRR – based on Article

306 (1b) – which means: Credit Risk Standardised Approach. Based on

Article 112 (g) - which is the next step in that “waterfall-model” - the

exposure class ‘Corporates’ has to be used. The table of Article 122 shows

the risk weights for corporates, percentages between 20 and 150, which

means normally 100 per cent. The next point is: CCPs have to be rated in

accordance with article 136 et seq. Under this article EBA, EIOPA and ESMA

have to formulate technical operating standards no later than 1st July 2014.

(But this is only a 'sideshow'.) Institutions are in a difficult situation at the

moment. Central question – two per cent or 100 per cent risk weigt for trade

exposure?

Final answer

If a central counterparty (""CCP"") has been either authorised or recognised in

accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (EMIR), then it is a qualifying

CCP and can be treated as such for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR).

If a CCP has not yet been authorised or recognised in accordance with EMIR

and the grandfathering period (including any extension thereof) specified in

Article 497 of the CRR has not yet elapsed, then the CCP can be treated as a

QCCP for the purposes of the CRR.

If a CCP has not yet been authorised or recognised in accordance with EMIR

and the grandfathering period (including any extension thereof) specified in

Article 497 of the CRR has elapsed, then the CCP must be treated as a non-

qualifying CCP for the purposes of the CRR.

Please also refer to Q&A 1126 for further details.

DISCLAIMER:

This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of

the regulatory framework. A Directorate General of the Commission

(Directorate General for Internal Market and Services) has prepared the

answer, albeit that only the Court of Justice of the European Union can

provide definitive interpretations of EU legislation. This is an unofficial

opinion of that Directorate General, which the European Banking Authority

publishes on its behalf. The answers are not binding on the European

Commission as an institution. You should be aware that the European

elements that may have been brought to its attention.

Subject matter Application of national decisions pursuant to Article 124(2) CRR

Question

Is it mandatory pursuant to Article 124(5) CRR for an institution in another

member state to apply national decisions, which purport to be released

pursuant to Article 124(2) CRR, but are not published on the EBA website

under Rules and Guidance?

1 of 9Furthermore, if such national decisions are not published under Rules and

Guidance, but e.g. under Options and national discretions only, is it

mandatory that institutions from other member states apply such decision

pursuant to Article 124(5) CRR?

Background on the

As a macro-prudential instrument, Article124 (2) CRR permits a (limited)

question

departure of the full harmonization, i.e. the tightening of European

requirements through national measures, existing within the scope of

application of the CRR under certain conditions. However, a tightening of

the risk weight for exposures fully secured by mortgages on residential

property or on commercial immovable property located in its territory, is

only permitted if loss experience show that the risk weights referred to in

Article125 (2) and/or Article126 (2) CRR, taking into account forward-looking

immovable property markets developments and financial stability

considerations, do not correspond to the actual risk of such exposures.

The consultation paper on regulatory technical standards pursuant to Article

124(4) CRR that has been published by EBA on 6 July 2015, specifies

particular aspects of the criteria set in Article 124(2). As the foreign

currency risk is not mentioned as relevant criterium in Article 124(2) CRR,

consequently, the consultation paper does not consider such aspect.

Q&A 2894 states that it is a requirement that competent authorities

regularly assess whether the risk weights are appropriately based on loss

experience and forward looking immovable property markets developments.

The competent national authorities should consult the EBA on the changes to

the risk weights and criteria applied. Compliance to this requirement is

necessary in order to ensure consistency in the application of higher risk

weights and stricter criteria.

It could be argued that a national decision, which is not based on the criteria

set out in Article 124(2) CRR, cannot comply with the consistency

requirement set out Q&A 2894. Furthermore, such consultation procedure

should allow the EBA to publish the changes to the risk weights and stricter

criteria on its website, such that institutions in all EU Member States can

apply these changes to the risk weights as required by Article 124(5) CRR.

It is therefore unclear whether an institution in another member state shall

apply a national decision, pursuant Article124(2) CRR, in particular in case

such decision:

is not confirmed by the publicly available analysis of the same national

competent authorities stating that the requirements of Article124(2)

CRR for an increase of risk weights are not fulfilled for the immovable

property market segment for which a higher risk weight had been

determined;.or

is based only on foreign currency risk considerations and not on

2 of 9immovable property market risk.

Final answer

In accordance with Article 124(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) as

amended, the designated authorities shall periodically assess whether the

risk-weight for the exposures referred to in Article 125 and 126 CRR located

in one or more parts of their territory are appropriately based on the loss

experience of exposures secured by immovable property and forward-looking

immovable property markets developments.

The same provision states that the designated authorities may set a higher

risk weight or stricter criteria than those set out in Article 125(2) and Article

126(2), where appropriate, on the basis of the described financial stability

considerations.

Article 124(6) CRR clarifies that the institutions of a Member State shall

apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the

authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph (2) to all

their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property

or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that

Member State.

The competent authorities shall notify EBA and the ESRB on the adjustments

to the risk weights and criteria applied and EBA and the ESRB shall provide

their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and ESRB shall publish

the risk weights and criteria that the relevant authorities set for exposures

referred to in Articles 125, 126 and 199(1)(a). As clarified in Q&A 2894,

compliance to this requirement is irrespective of the possible lack of

regulatory standards.

Institutions should not put into doubt the correctness of the assessment and

consultation on the adjustment of the risk weights published by the EBA and

the ESRB and available on the website under the section Rules and Guidance

- List of changes to risk weights or stricter criteria for exposures secured by

immovable property (Article 124 CRR).

Subject matter Obligation to carry out analysis and to consult with EBA on planned increase

of risk weights before RTS on this matter are finally adopted and published

in the Official Journal of the European Union

Question

Is there an obligation to carry out appropriate analysis and to consult with

EBA on planned increase of risk weights since RTS on this matter are not

finally adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union?

Background on the

Polish Financial Supervision Authority in cooperation with Polish Ministry of

question

Finance wants to make use of Article 124 (2) of the CRR since higher risk

weights (100%) on exposures denominated in foreign currency had been

present in national law prior to introduction of CRDIV/CRR. They prepared

proposal of legal act based on Article 124 (2), increasing risk weights in

banks in Poland for foreign currency denominated expos.

Final answer

The first sub-paragraph of Article 124(2) CRR states that the competent or

designated authorityies shall periodically and at least annually assess

whether the risk weight of 35% for exposures to one or more property

segments secured by mortgages on residential property referred to in Article

125 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the

relevant authority and the risk weight of 50% for exposures secured by

mortgages on commercial immovable property referred to in Article 126

located in one or more parts of the their territory of the Member State of the

relevant authority are appropriately based on (a) the loss experience and (b)

forward-looking immovable property markets developments. This

requirement applies irrespective of the draft regulatory standards being

submitted to the Commission.

The same applies to the requirement to consult notify the EBA and the ESRB

on the adjustments to the risk weights and criteria applied, as referred to in

the sixth sub-paragraph of Article 124(2) CRR: the competent or designated

authorityies should consult the EBA on the changes to the risk weights and

4 of 9criteria applied, irrespective of the draft regulatory standards on this topic

being finalised. Compliance to this requirement is necessary in order to

ensure consistency in the application of higher risk weights and stricter

criteria, and in order to allow the EBA to publish the changes to the risk

weights and stricter criteria on its website, such that institutions in all EU

Member States can apply these changes to the risk weights as required by

Article 124(5)(6) CRR.

Subject matter Applicability of the transitional period under Article 124(3) of Regulation

(EU) No. 575/2013

Question

According to Article 124(3) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR),

institutions should have a 6-month transitional period to apply higher risk

weights set by the competent or designated authorities to exposures secured

by mortgages on immovable property.

Should this transitional period also apply if the national authority decides

under CRR to set risk weights at the same level and to the same extent, i.e.

for the same kind of exposures that are currently set under CRD (so in fact

such decision would not result in a higher capital requirements for banks in

5 of 9comparison to current national legislation)?

Background on the

According to current Polish legislation, for FX exposures secured by

question

mortgages on residential property, a 100% risk weight is applied. A 50% risk

weight for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable

property is not allowed (except for leasing transactions and properties

located in countries where 50% risk weight is applied) and 100% risk weight

is applied. Taking into account the above, the 100% risk weight in case of

aforementioned exposures, however higher than ""general"" level, would in

fact remain unchanged. So, the transitional period does not seem to be

justified or needed.

Final answer

Article 124(3) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) provides that ""when

the competent or designated authorities set a higher risk weight or stricter

criteria, institutions shall have a 6-month transitional period to apply the

new risk weight"". The purpose of this transitional provision is to provide

institutions with the necessary time to adapt to the new risk weights. In the

event that no new risk weights are imposed under the provisions of Article

124(2) of the CRR, the transitional period is not relevant.

Subject matter Immovable property risk weights under the standardised approach

(residential)

Question

Is the 35% standardised risk weight applicable to exposures fully and

completely secured by mortgages on residential property outside the Union?

Background on the

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) allows for exposures

question

fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential property to receive

a 35% risk weight where the conditions in 125(2) are met unless otherwise

decided by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 124(2).

Competent authorities can increase risk weights in their territory based on

loss experience and forward-looking property market developments but the

Regulation is silent on how risk weights should be determined for property

markets outside the Union .e.g. Hong Kong.

Final answer

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does apply to

exposures secured by mortgages on residential property outside of the

Union. Article 124(2) requires in the fifth subparagraph that for property in

their territory, competent authorities have to set a higher risk weight

corresponding to the actual risks under certain conditions. For third

countries, Article 124(2) does not establish such a requirement but

competent authorities are still able to set higher risk weights or apply

stricter criteria for exposures secured by immovable property located in

third countries based on financial stability considerations as set out in the

second, third and fourth subparagraphs and after consultation with EBA in

accordance with the sixth subparagraph.

Subject matter The risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU’s exposures in mandate based

approach

Question

Could the institution use the information from the CIU management

company about the notional amount of derivative positions of CIU to assess

the value of those derivatives in calculating risk-weighted exposure amount

of CIU when using the mandate based approach in accordance with Article

132a(2) CRR?

In particular, is the institution allowed to use the information from the CIU

management company, that CIU doesn’t have derivatives in their portfolio

and assess the value of those derivatives as zero in calculating risk-weighted

exposure amount of CIU when using the mandate based approach in

accordance with Article 132a(2) CRR?

Background on the

1 of 5question According to Article 132a(2) CRR, where the conditions set out in Article

132(3) CRR are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information

about the individual underlying exposures of a collective investment

undertaking (CIU) to use the look-through approach may calculate the risk-

weighted exposure amount of those exposures in accordance with the limits

set in the CIU's mandate and relevant law. To calculate risk-weighted assets

using the MBA institution should take into account balance sheet exposures,

off-balance-sheet items and the Counterparty Credit Risk associated with the

fund's derivative exposures. Assume, that the CIU’s mandate allow CIU to

invest in derivatives only for hedging purposes. But the CIU’s mandate

doesn’t specify the notional amount of derivatives position. The institution

has information from the CIU management company about:

current CIU’s notional amount of derivatives position

or lack of derivatives in the CIU’s portfolio.

Is the institution allowed to use such an information as base to calculate risk-

weighted exposure amount of CIU when using the mandate based approach

in accordance with Article 132a(2) of CRR?

Final answer

According to the last subparagraph Article 132(2) of Regulation (EU)

575/2013, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (CRR), institutions may

use a combination of the look-through approach (LTA), the mandate-based

approach (MBA) and the fallback approach (FBA) to determine their

minimum capital requirements for credit risk for their exposures in the form

of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIU), provided that

the relevant conditions for applying the LTA or the MBA are met. This also

applies at the level of an individual underlying exposure of the CIU. The use

of the LTA and the MBA are subject to the conditions set out in Article

132(3) and depend on if institutions have sufficient information about the

individual underlying exposures of a CIU or not.

Thus, an institution can apply a combination of the LTA for determining the

exposure value of an underlying exposure of the CIU, where it has sufficient

information provided by the CIU or the CIU management company – even if

that information reveals that the CIU does not hold certain types of

exposures – and the MBA for determining the maximum risk weight of that

Subject matter Applicability of Look through Approach to SPV (Article 132 CRR)

Question

May the look-through approach be applied for exposures in Notes issued by a

special purpose vehicle, with no tranches, - which is unclear whether it

qualifies as an undertaking for collective investment according to the

applicable national law -, where the paid out of the each Note are the net

proceeds of the loan receivables portfolio allocated to such Note (provided

the additional requirements set for the look through approach are duly met)?

Background on the

In order to finance the acquisition of the underlying (loan receivables), the

question

SPV issues notes depending on payments of the underlyings. The notes are

“Borrower payment contingent notes”, meaning that all payments (cash

outflows) on the notes to the investors will depend on payments (cash

inflows) received from the underlyings.

Payments on a note to the investors solely and exclusively depend on cash

flows from the underlyings that refer to that note. All notes are legally ring-

fenced from each other, so that a defined underlying serves only for the

referred note. In addition, there is no hierarchy of payments between the

note holders. The allocation of losses solely depends on the performance of

the underlyings. The notes do not qualify as tranches as defined by CRR.

3 of 5The Issuer is bankruptcy remote, meaning that even if losses occur in the

underlyings will not lead to a liquidation or wind-down of the SPV. Losses

are solely allocated to the notes they refer to.

The notes are guaranteed by neither the Issuer nor an Originator.

The issuer functions exactly as a CIU as the performance and, therefore, the

risks of the notes issued are solely depending on the underlying assets (loan

receivables).

Final answer

Conditions and eligibility criteria to apply the look through approach to

exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertaking

(CIUs) are set out in Article 132(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013

(CRR) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876.

Article 4(1)(7) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as amended by Regulation (EU)

2019/876 defines a CIU as an UCITS as defined in Article 1(2) of Directive

2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council or an alternative

investment fund (AIF) as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive

2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.

The definition of AIF in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU specifies the

features of collective investment undertakings that qualify as an AIF - and

therefore as CIU for the CRR – as being undertakings “which raise capital

from a number of investors, with a view to investing it in accordance with a

defined investment policy for the benefit of those investors”. The only

additional feature to qualify as AIF is not already qualifying as UCITS, the

latter requiring authorisation pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2009/65/EC.

Moreover, the definition of AIF explicitly includes compartments of collective

investment undertakings. Additional guidance on the characteristics, which -

if all exhibited by an undertaking - should show that an undertaking is a

collective investment undertaking mentioned in Article 4(1)(a) of the AIFMD,

can be found in paragraph 12 of the ESMA Guidelines on key concepts of the

AIFMD. If the entity fulfills the definition set in Article 4(1)(7) CRR, then it

qualifies as a CIU. In that respect, institutions shall only determine the risk

weight for exposures using the look-through approach according to Article

132a(1) CRR and fulfilling the conditions and eligibility criteria of Articles

132(3) and 132(4) CRR to structures qualifying as CIU.

Whether the SPV in question and separately each of the compartments,

formed by ring-fencing each note and the assigned underlying from each

other note and their assigned underlying, might qualify as AIF and therefore

as CIU for the purpose of the CRR needs to be assessed individually for the

specific case and therefore cannot be finally clarified as part of a Q&A.

Subject matter Application of national decisions pursuant to Article 124(2) CRR

Question

Is it mandatory pursuant to Article 124(5) CRR for an institution in another

member state to apply national decisions, which purport to be released

pursuant to Article 124(2) CRR, but are not published on the EBA website

under Rules and Guidance?

1 of 9Furthermore, if such national decisions are not published under Rules and

Guidance, but e.g. under Options and national discretions only, is it

mandatory that institutions from other member states apply such decision

pursuant to Article 124(5) CRR?

Background on the

As a macro-prudential instrument, Article124 (2) CRR permits a (limited)

question

departure of the full harmonization, i.e. the tightening of European

requirements through national measures, existing within the scope of

application of the CRR under certain conditions. However, a tightening of

the risk weight for exposures fully secured by mortgages on residential

property or on commercial immovable property located in its territory, is

only permitted if loss experience show that the risk weights referred to in

Article125 (2) and/or Article126 (2) CRR, taking into account forward-looking

immovable property markets developments and financial stability

considerations, do not correspond to the actual risk of such exposures.

The consultation paper on regulatory technical standards pursuant to Article

124(4) CRR that has been published by EBA on 6 July 2015, specifies

particular aspects of the criteria set in Article 124(2). As the foreign

currency risk is not mentioned as relevant criterium in Article 124(2) CRR,

consequently, the consultation paper does not consider such aspect.

Q&A 2894 states that it is a requirement that competent authorities

regularly assess whether the risk weights are appropriately based on loss

experience and forward looking immovable property markets developments.

The competent national authorities should consult the EBA on the changes to

the risk weights and criteria applied. Compliance to this requirement is

necessary in order to ensure consistency in the application of higher risk

weights and stricter criteria.

It could be argued that a national decision, which is not based on the criteria

set out in Article 124(2) CRR, cannot comply with the consistency

requirement set out Q&A 2894. Furthermore, such consultation procedure

should allow the EBA to publish the changes to the risk weights and stricter

criteria on its website, such that institutions in all EU Member States can

apply these changes to the risk weights as required by Article 124(5) CRR.

It is therefore unclear whether an institution in another member state shall

apply a national decision, pursuant Article124(2) CRR, in particular in case

such decision:

is not confirmed by the publicly available analysis of the same national

competent authorities stating that the requirements of Article124(2)

CRR for an increase of risk weights are not fulfilled for the immovable

property market segment for which a higher risk weight had been

determined;.or

is based only on foreign currency risk considerations and not on

2 of 9immovable property market risk.

Final answer

In accordance with Article 124(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) as

amended, the designated authorities shall periodically assess whether the

risk-weight for the exposures referred to in Article 125 and 126 CRR located

in one or more parts of their territory are appropriately based on the loss

experience of exposures secured by immovable property and forward-looking

immovable property markets developments.

The same provision states that the designated authorities may set a higher

risk weight or stricter criteria than those set out in Article 125(2) and Article

126(2), where appropriate, on the basis of the described financial stability

considerations.

Article 124(6) CRR clarifies that the institutions of a Member State shall

apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the

authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph (2) to all

their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property

or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that

Member State.

The competent authorities shall notify EBA and the ESRB on the adjustments

to the risk weights and criteria applied and EBA and the ESRB shall provide

their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and ESRB shall publish

the risk weights and criteria that the relevant authorities set for exposures

referred to in Articles 125, 126 and 199(1)(a). As clarified in Q&A 2894,

compliance to this requirement is irrespective of the possible lack of

regulatory standards.

Institutions should not put into doubt the correctness of the assessment and

consultation on the adjustment of the risk weights published by the EBA and

the ESRB and available on the website under the section Rules and Guidance

- List of changes to risk weights or stricter criteria for exposures secured by

immovable property (Article 124 CRR).

Subject matter Obligation to carry out analysis and to consult with EBA on planned increase

of risk weights before RTS on this matter are finally adopted and published

in the Official Journal of the European Union

Question

Is there an obligation to carry out appropriate analysis and to consult with

EBA on planned increase of risk weights since RTS on this matter are not

finally adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union?

Background on the

Polish Financial Supervision Authority in cooperation with Polish Ministry of

question

Finance wants to make use of Article 124 (2) of the CRR since higher risk

weights (100%) on exposures denominated in foreign currency had been

present in national law prior to introduction of CRDIV/CRR. They prepared

proposal of legal act based on Article 124 (2), increasing risk weights in

banks in Poland for foreign currency denominated expos.

Final answer

The first sub-paragraph of Article 124(2) CRR states that the competent or

designated authorityies shall periodically and at least annually assess

whether the risk weight of 35% for exposures to one or more property

segments secured by mortgages on residential property referred to in Article

125 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the

relevant authority and the risk weight of 50% for exposures secured by

mortgages on commercial immovable property referred to in Article 126

located in one or more parts of the their territory of the Member State of the

relevant authority are appropriately based on (a) the loss experience and (b)

forward-looking immovable property markets developments. This

requirement applies irrespective of the draft regulatory standards being

submitted to the Commission.

The same applies to the requirement to consult notify the EBA and the ESRB

on the adjustments to the risk weights and criteria applied, as referred to in

the sixth sub-paragraph of Article 124(2) CRR: the competent or designated

authorityies should consult the EBA on the changes to the risk weights and

4 of 9criteria applied, irrespective of the draft regulatory standards on this topic

being finalised. Compliance to this requirement is necessary in order to

ensure consistency in the application of higher risk weights and stricter

criteria, and in order to allow the EBA to publish the changes to the risk

weights and stricter criteria on its website, such that institutions in all EU

Member States can apply these changes to the risk weights as required by

Article 124(5)(6) CRR.

Subject matter Applicability of the transitional period under Article 124(3) of Regulation

(EU) No. 575/2013

Question

According to Article 124(3) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR),

institutions should have a 6-month transitional period to apply higher risk

weights set by the competent or designated authorities to exposures secured

by mortgages on immovable property.

Should this transitional period also apply if the national authority decides

under CRR to set risk weights at the same level and to the same extent, i.e.

for the same kind of exposures that are currently set under CRD (so in fact

such decision would not result in a higher capital requirements for banks in

5 of 9comparison to current national legislation)?

Background on the

According to current Polish legislation, for FX exposures secured by

question

mortgages on residential property, a 100% risk weight is applied. A 50% risk

weight for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable

property is not allowed (except for leasing transactions and properties

located in countries where 50% risk weight is applied) and 100% risk weight

is applied. Taking into account the above, the 100% risk weight in case of

aforementioned exposures, however higher than ""general"" level, would in

fact remain unchanged. So, the transitional period does not seem to be

justified or needed.

Final answer

Article 124(3) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) provides that ""when

the competent or designated authorities set a higher risk weight or stricter

criteria, institutions shall have a 6-month transitional period to apply the

new risk weight"". The purpose of this transitional provision is to provide

institutions with the necessary time to adapt to the new risk weights. In the

event that no new risk weights are imposed under the provisions of Article

124(2) of the CRR, the transitional period is not relevant.

Subject matter Immovable property risk weights under the standardised approach

(residential)

Question

Is the 35% standardised risk weight applicable to exposures fully and

completely secured by mortgages on residential property outside the Union?

Background on the

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) allows for exposures

question

fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential property to receive

a 35% risk weight where the conditions in 125(2) are met unless otherwise

decided by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 124(2).

Competent authorities can increase risk weights in their territory based on

loss experience and forward-looking property market developments but the

Regulation is silent on how risk weights should be determined for property

markets outside the Union .e.g. Hong Kong.

Final answer

Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does apply to

exposures secured by mortgages on residential property outside of the

Union. Article 124(2) requires in the fifth subparagraph that for property in

their territory, competent authorities have to set a higher risk weight

corresponding to the actual risks under certain conditions. For third

countries, Article 124(2) does not establish such a requirement but

competent authorities are still able to set higher risk weights or apply

stricter criteria for exposures secured by immovable property located in

third countries based on financial stability considerations as set out in the

second, third and fourth subparagraphs and after consultation with EBA in

accordance with the sixth subparagraph.

Subject matter Exemption from deduction of Equity Holdings in an insurance company from

CET1

Question

Pursuant to Article 471(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), in order

not to deduct the equity investment in an insurance company, should “the

amount of the equity holding which is “not deducted” not exceed (i) the

“amount of shares” (13% share of the insurance company’s capital) or (ii) the

“book value” (EUR 2 billion), held in the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments

in the Insurance company as of December 31, 2012?

Background on the

An institution holds an equity investment in an insurance company. Under

question

Article 471 (1), the institution decides to exercise the exemption of equity

holdings in insurance companies from CET1 by the end of 2014, according to

relevant decisions of the competent authorities. As of December 31, 2012,

the percentage of the equity investment in the insurance company is 13%

and the book value, calculated using the equity method, is €2bn. As of

December 31, 2014, the percentage of the equity investment in the

insurance company remains at 13% and the new book value increases to

€2.3bn only because of the application of the equity method (without any

further investment). In any case, the exercise of the exemption meets all the

conditions set out in Article 471, points (a), (b) and (c).

1 of 2Final answer

FFor the purpose of Article 471(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013

(CRR), the equity holdings of the institution in the insurance company shall

not exceed 15% of the CET1 instruments issued by that insurance company

as at 31 December 2012 and during the period from 1 January 2013 and 31

December 2022 2024. If this condition is not met then the equity holding of

the institution in the insurance company shall be deducted. For the purpose

of Article 471(1)(d) of the CRR, the amount of the equity holdings not

deducted shall not exceed the amount held in CET1 instruments in the

insurance company as at 31 December 2012. These two conditions apply

together and shall be met in order for equity holdings not to be deducted.

In the case submitted, as of 31 December 2014, the equity holding of the

institution in the insurance company (13%) remains below the threshold of

15%. The condition of Article 471(1)(c) of the CRR is thus met. However, the

amount of the equity holding in the insurance company at that date ( EUR ac

2.3bn) is above the cap of EURac2bn, which results from the application of

Article 471(1)(d). Therefore, in the situation described, the amount of the

equity holding that could be risk-weighted would be EUR 2bn. EUR 0.3bn

would have to be deducted from own funds.

Subject matter Definition of exposure class ""Exposures in default"" under SA approach

Question

Are all exposures of the defaulted obligor taken into account when assigning

exposures into the exposure class ""Exposures in default"" or just individual

exposure(s) of that obligor that is (are) in default, since the definition of

""Exposures in default"" has changed (default definition according to the IRB

approach)?

Background on the

The definition of exposures in default has changed compared to Directive

question

2006/48/EC in a way that the reference regarding the default definition is

made to the IRB approach. So when default of the obligor occurs under this

definition (Article 178 of the CRR), all exposures of defaulted obligor are

taken into account. However under the SA approach the treatment so far

was(is) that only exposures that are past due more than 90 days are

categorised under ""Exposures in default"". Since the latter definition has

changed, my question is whether still only individual exposures that had

defaulted under the IRB definition are taken into account in the SA

approach.

Final answer

Yes, all exposures of a defaulted obligor must be assigned to the exposure

1 of 2class ""Exposures in default"" under Article 127 of Regulation (EU) No

575/2013 (CRR), except for those retail exposures to an obligor, for which

the definition of default in Article 178 of this Regulation is not met (i.e.

individual credit facility approach).

Article 127 of the CRR applies to any item where the obligor has defaulted in

accordance with Article 178, but in the case of retail exposures solely to any

credit facility which has defaulted in accordance with Article 178. Article 178

of the CRR states that in the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply

the definition of default laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first

subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in

relation to the total obligations of a borrower.

Subject matter Immovable property risk weights under the standardised approach

(commercial)

Question

Is the 50% standardised risk weight applicable to exposures fully and

completely secured by mortgages on commercial property outside the

Union?

Background on the

Article 126(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) allows for exposures

question

fully and completely secured by mortgages on commercial property to

receive a 50% risk weight where the conditions in 126(2) are met unless

otherwise decided by the competent authorities in accordance with Article

124(2). Competent authorities can increase risk weights in their territory

based on loss experience and forward-looking property market developments

but the Regulation is silent on how risk weights should be determined for

property markets outside the Union .e.g. Hong Kong.

Final answer

Article 126(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) does apply to

exposures secured by mortgages on residential commercial* property

outside of the Union. Article 124(2) requires in the fifth subparagraph that

for property in their territory, competent authorities have to set a higher risk

1 of 2weight corresponding to the actual risks under certain conditions. For third

countries, Article 124(2) does not establish such a requirement but

competent authorities are still able to set higher risk weights or apply

stricter criteria for exposures secured by immovable property located in

third countries based on financial stability considerations as set out in the

second, third and fourth subparagraphs and after consultation with EBA in

accordance with the sixth subparagraph.

Subject matter Conditions for application of 4% risk weight

Question

Please confirm that the criteria in Article 305(2)(a) is met with gross

omnibus segregation solutions that provide the same level of segregation as

individual segregation (e.g. account segregation with asset-tagging, where

good individual asset attribution yields the same results as individual

segregation).

Background on the

Article 305(2)(a) and Article 305(3) together provide the risk weights for

question

segregation, replacing (under certain circumstances) the 2% risk weight in

Article 306 with 4% risk weight. We believe that Legal Segregation with

Operation Comingling, for example, meets the criteria in Article 305(2)(a).

Final answer

Article 305, together with Article 306 of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013

(CRR), allow a preferential treatment for client exposures towards a QCCP

1 of 3provided certain eligibility criteria are fully or partially met. Article 305(2)(a)

contains a core criteria that explicitly requests that:

""the positions and assets of that institution related to those transactions are

distinguished and segregated, at the level of both the clearing member and

the CCP, from the positions and assets of both the clearing member and the

other clients of that clearing member and as a result of that distinction and

segregation those positions and assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of

the default or insolvency of the clearing member or one or more of its other

clients;""

Therefore, the CRR clearly requires use of a clearing account that provides

at least an equivalent level of client protection as individual client

segregation. In order to benefit from the 2% risk weight the client must not

be exposed to risk arising other than from its own positions and assets. If

the client is exposed to a double default of its clearing member and another

client, or to a loss of value of other clients' collateral, then it should not

benefit from the 2% weighting. 'Asset-tagging' or 'good individual asset

attributions' do not necessarily guarantee this condition nor the other

conditions laid down in Article 305(2) of the CRR in practice.

In the instance where a client faces fellow client risk, as described in Article

305(3) of the CRR, where an institution that is a client is not protected from

losses in the case that the clearing member and another client of the

clearing member jointly default, they may benefit from the 4% risk weight so

long as all other conditions of Article 305(2) are met. This would also include

the condition that the positions and assets of that institution related to their

CCP-related transactions are still distinguished and segregated at the level

of both the clearing member and CCP, from the positions and assets of both

the clearing member and the other clients of that clearing member.

Following this, gross omnibus segregation (legal segregation & operational

comingling) may be an acceptable level of segregation for institutions if they

can demonstrate to offer the aforementioned level of protection.

Where the conditions of Article 305(2) or (3) of the CRR are not met, the

institution shall calculate the own funds requirements in accordance with

Article 305(1).

Background on the

For a bank using the FCCM exposure calculation method for SFT according

question

to Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR (Article 223), it is not clear how to

populate columns 0030, 0040/0050 and 0150 of template C 34.02.

The notional amount and the CMV are not recognized concepts for SFT.

These parameters are not quoted in any article regarding SFT.

A repo transaction is composed by only 2 parameters, the security posted

and the cash received.

We understand that the notional amount (column 0030) is “before any

netting and without any adjustments” so the security value posted (or the

security nominal) is expected for a repo transaction.

The CMV is “gross of any collateral held or posted” and “where positive and

negative market values are netted”. We understand that the CMV is the

security value posted for a repo transaction.

For the exposure pre-crm, it says “ collateralised business shall be handled

as uncollateralised, i.e. no margining effects apply”. We understand that it is

the security value posted that is expected.

The security value posted is “expected” to be reported 3 times in the

columns 0030, 0040/0050 and 0150 as we understand the ITS instructions.

Final answer

In accordance with Annex II to the Commission Implementing Regulation

(EU) 2021/451 (ITS on Supervisory Reporting, ITS) securities financing

transaction may be reported in template C 34.02 following article 223 of

Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) (i.e. applying Financial Collateral Comprehensive

2 of 3method). Regarding reporting of specific columns, institutions shall report in

column 0030 the notional value of the asset. Columns 0040 and 0050 shall be

populated with the net market value of a transactions within a netting set

gross on any collateral held or posted (i.e. market value of the whole netting

set made by SFTs). Finally, for transactions under Financial Collateral

Comprehensive, column 0150 shall be reported following article 223 of the

CRR. Nevertheless, received collateral shall not decrease the exposure value

and collateral posted shall be considered in the determination of the

exposure value pre-CRM as it is stated in the template C 34.02 instructions.

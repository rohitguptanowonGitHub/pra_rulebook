Article4,"4 The Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The detailed liquidity coverage requirement in accordance with Article

and shall be expressed as a percentage. Credit institutions shall

calculate their liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with the following

formula:

Liquidity Buffer

Net Liquidity Outflows over a 30 calendar day stress period

= Liquidity Coverage Ratio (%)

Credit institutions shall maintain a liquidity coverage ratio of at least

100%.

By derogation from paragr | 2, credit institutions may monetise their

liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows during stress periods,

even if such a use of liquid assets may result in their liquidity coverage

ratio falling below 100% during such periods.

Where at any time the liquidity coverage ratio of a credit institution has

fallen or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100%, the requirement

laid down in Arti 14 of CRR shall apply. Until the liquidity coverage

ratio has been restored to the level referred to in paragraph 2, the credit

Credit institutions shall calculate and monitor their liquidity coverage ratio

in the reporting currency for all items, irrespective of their actual

currency denomination.

liquidity coverage ratio for certain items as follows:

(a) for items that are subject to separate reporting in a currency other

than the reporting currency in accordance with Article 415(2) of

liquidity coverage ratio in that other currency;

(b) for items denominated in the reporting currency where the

aggregate amount of liabilities denominated in currencies other than

the reporting currency equals or exceeds 5% of the credit

institution's total liabilities, excluding regulatory capital and off-

balance-sheet items, credit institutions shall separately calculate and

monitor their liquidity coverage ratio in the reporting currency

Article7,"7 General Requirements for Liquid Assets

In order to qualify as liquid assets, the assets of a credit institution shall

The assets shall be a property, right, entitlement, or interest, that is held

by the credit institution, or included in a pool as referred to in point (a),

and is free from any encumbrance. For those purposes, an asset shall be

deemed to be unencumbered where it is not subject to any legal,

contractual, regulatory or other restriction preventing the credit institution

01/01/2022

01/01/2022

from liquidating, selling, transferring, assigning or, generally, disposing of

the asset via an outright sale or a repurchase agreement within the

following 30 calendar days. The following assets shall be deemed to be

unencumbered:

(a) assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as

collateral to obtain additional funding under committed but not yet

funded credit lines available to the credit institution or, if the pool is

operated by a central bank, under uncommitted and not yet funded

credit lines available to the credit institution. Credit institutions shall

assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing

liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in 1 Chapter 2(b) assets that the credit institution has received as collateral for credit

risk mitigation purposes in reverse repo or securities financing

transactions and that the credit institution may dispose of.

The assets shall not have been issued by the credit institution itself, its

parent undertaking, other than a public sector entity that is not a credit

institution, its subsidiary or another subsidiary of its parent undertaking or

by a securitisation special purpose entity with which the credit institution

has close links.

The assets shall not have been issued by any of the following:

(a) another credit institution, unless one or more of the following

conditions is met:

(i) the issuer is a public sector entity referred to in point (c) of Article

10(1) or in point (a) or (b) of Article 11(1);

01/01/2022

b) an investment firm;

c) an insurance undertaking;

d) a reinsurance undertaking;

e) a financial holding company;

f) a mixed financial holding company;

g) any other entity that performs one or more of the Annex 1 activities as

its main business. For the purposes of this Article, SSPEs shall be

deemed not included within the entities referred to in this point.

The value of the assets shall be capable of being determined on the

basis of widely disseminated and easily available market prices. In the

absence of market-based prices, the value of the assets must be capable

of being determined on the basis of an easy-to-calculate formula that

uses publicly available inputs and is not significantly dependent upon

strong assumptions.

The assets shall be listed on a recognised exchange or tradable via

active outright sale or via simple repurchase transaction on generally

accepted repurchase markets. These criteria shall be assessed

separately for each market. An asset admitted to trading in an organisedvenue which is not a recognised exchange, either in the United

trading venue provides for an active and sizable market for outright sales

of assets. The credit institution shall take into account the following as

minimum criteria to assess whether a trading venue provides for an

active and sizeable market for the purposes of this paragraph:

(a) historical evidence of market breadth and depth as proven by low bid-

ask spreads, high trading volume and a large and diverse number of

market participants;

(b) the presence of a robust market infrastructure.

Article8,"8 Operational Requirements

Credit institutions shall have policies and limits in place to ensure that the

holdings of liquid assets comprising their liquidity buffer remain

appropriately diversified at all times. For those purposes, credit

institutions shall take into account the extent of diversification between

the various categories of liquid assets and within the same > category of

liquid assets referred to in CI

and any other relevant diversification factors, such as types of issuers,

counterparties or the geographical location of those issuers and

counterparties.

Credit institutions shall have ready access to their holdings of liquid

assets and be able to monetise them at any time during the 30 calendar

day stress period via outright sale or repurchase agreement on generally

accepted repurchase markets. A liquid asset shall be deemed readily

accessible to a credit institution where there are no legal or practical

impediments to the credit institution's ability to monetise such an asset in

a timely fashion.Assets used to provide credit enhancement in structured transactions or

to cover operational costs of the credit institutions shall not be deemed

as readily accessible to a credit institution.

01/01/2022

01/01/2022

Assets held in a third country where there are restrictions to their free

transferability shall be deemed readily accessible only insofar as the

credit institution uses those assets to meet liquidity outflows in that third

country. Assets held in a non-convertible currency shall be deemed

readily accessible only insofar as the credit institution uses those assets

to meet liquidity outflows in that currency.

Credit institutions shall ensure that their liquid assets are under the

control of a specific liquidity management function within the credit

institution by:

(a) placing the liquid assets in a separate pool under the direct

management of the liquidity function and with the sole intent of using

them as a source of contingent funds, including during stress

periods; or

(b) putting in place internal systems and controls to give the liquidity

management function effective operational control to monetise the

holdings of liquid assets at any point in the 30 calendar day stress

period and to access the contingent funds without directly conflicting

with any existing business or risk management strategies. In

particular, an asset shall not be included in the liquidity buffer where

monetisation of the asset without replacement throughout the 30

calendar day stress period would remove a hedge that would create

an open risk position in excess of the internal limits of the credit

institution; or

(c) a combination of options (a) and (b), if appropriate.

Credit institutions shall regularly, and at least once a year, monetise a

sufficiently representative sample of their holdings of liquid assets by

means of outright sale or simple repurchase agreement on a generally

accepted repurchase market. Credit institutions shall develop strategies

for disposing of samples of liquid assets which are adequate to:

(a) test the access to the market for those assets and their usability;

01/01/2022

01/01/202201/01/2022

(b) check that the credit institution's processes for the timely monetisation

of assets are effective;

(c) minimise the risk of sending a negative signal to the market as a

result of the credit institution's monetising its assets during stress

periods.

The requirement laid down in the first subparagraph shall not apply to

level 1 assets referred to in Article 10, other than extremely high quality

covered bonds, to the restricted-use committed liquidity facility referred to

in subparagraph (d) of Article 12(1).

assets provided that the following conditions are met:

(a) the credit institution puts in place appropriate internal arrangements in

continue to be readily available and under the control of the liquidity

management function;

(b) the net liquidity outflows and inflows that would result in the event

of an early close-out of the hedge are taken into account in the

valuation of the relevant asset in accordance with Article 9.

Credit institutions shall ensure that the currency denomination of their

liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of their net

liquidity outflows.

For the purposes of calculating its liquidity coverage ratio, a credit

institution shall use the market value of its liquid assets. The market

value of liquid assets shall be reduced in accordance with the haircuts
